Hydrodynamic theories hold promise for simplified, universal descriptions of these collective behaviors. However, incorporating the individual preferences of decision-making organisms into a hydrodynamic theory is an open problem. Here, we develop a data-driven pipeline that links micromotives to macrobehavior by augmenting hydrodynamics with utility functions that describe individual preferences in microeconomics. We show how to systematically validate the hypotheses underlying this construction from data using statistical tools based on neural networks. We illustrate this pipeline on the case study of human residential dynamics in the United States, for which census and sociological data is available, and show how trends in sociological surveys can be related to trends seen in racial segregation. In particular, we highlight that a history-dependence in the segregation-integration transition can arise even when agents have no memory. Beyond residential segregation, our work paves the way for systematic investigations of social-driven motility in real space from micro-organisms to humans, as well as fitness-mediated motion in more abstract genomic spaces.","2024-01-28","2024-01-31 13:27:57","2024-01-31 13:28:10","2024-01-31 13:27:57","","","","","","","Sociohydrodynamics","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2312.17627 [cond-mat, physics:nlin, physics:physics]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/89FFTAPK/seara2024.pdf","","⭐️","⛔ No INSPIRE recid found; Condensed Matter - Soft Condensed Matter; Condensed Matter - Statistical Mechanics; Nonlinear Sciences - Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems; Nonlinear Sciences - Pattern Formation and Solitons; Physics - Physics and Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2312.17627","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that the inclusion of JT gravity on the brane leads to interesting effects on time dependence of holographic complexity. We identify the region in parameter space (the brane location and the JT coupling) for which the rate of change of complexity violates the Lloyd bound. In an equivalent description of the model in terms of an asymptotically AdS wormhole, we connect the violation of the Lloyd bound to the violation of a suitable energy condition in the bulk that we introduce.

We propose and develop a complementary version of this conjecture: quantum chaotic systems display a Lanczos spectrum whose local means and covariances are well described by RMT. To support this proposal, we first demonstrate its validity in examples of chaotic and integrable systems. We then show that for Haar-random initial states in RMTs the mean and covariance of the Lanczos spectrum suffices to produce the full long time behavior of general survival probabilities including the spectral form factor, as well as the spread complexity. In addition, for initial states with continuous overlap with energy eigenstates, we analytically find the long time averages of the probabilities of Krylov basis elements in terms of the mean Lanczos spectrum. This analysis suggests a notion of eigenstate complexity, the statistics of which differentiate integrable systems and classes of quantum chaos.

The null eigenvalues of this matrix are in one-to-one correspondence with conserved quantities that have simple locality properties (a hallmark of integrability). The typical magnitude of the eigenvalues, on the other hand, controls an explicit bound on Nielsen's complexity of the quantum evolution operator, defined in terms of the same locality specifications.

Complexity is understood here as the shortest geodesic distance between the time-dependent evolution operator and the origin within the group of unitaries. (An appropriate `complexity metric' must be used that takes into account the relative difficulty of performing `nonlocal' operations that act on many degrees of freedom at once.) While simply formulated and geometrically attractive, this notion of complexity is numerically intractable save for toy models with Hilbert spaces of very low dimensions. To bypass this difficulty, we trade the exact definition in terms of geodesics for an upper bound on complexity, obtained by minimizing the distance over an explicitly prescribed infinite set of curves, rather than over all possible curves. Identifying this upper bound turns out equivalent to the closest vector problem (CVP) previously studied in integer optimization theory, in particular, in relation to lattice-based cryptography. Effective approximate algorithms are hence provided by the existing mathematical considerations, and they can be utilized in our analysis of the upper bounds on quantum evolution complexity. The resulting algorithmically implemented complexity bound systematically assigns lower values to integrable than to chaotic systems, as we demonstrate by explicit numerical work for Hilbert spaces of dimensions up to ~10^4.","2022-10-11","2024-01-29 08:45:07","2024-02-18 13:41:10","2024-01-29 08:45:07","090","","4","13","","SciPost Phys.","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2039758","arXiv.org","","7 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 5 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) arXiv:2202.13924 [quant-ph] Citation Key: Craps:2022ese","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/VAB89DMX/Craps2022ese.pdf","","✔️","Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms; High Energy Physics - Theory; Mathematics - Optimization and Control; Physics - Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability; Quantum Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The hypothesis states that successive Lanczos coefficients in the continued fraction expansion of the Green's functions grow linearly with rate $\alpha$ in generic systems, with an extra logarithmic correction in 1d. The rate $\alpha$ --- an experimental observable --- governs the exponential growth of operator complexity in a sense we make precise. This exponential growth even prevails beyond semiclassical or large-$N$ limits. Moreover, $\alpha$ upper bounds a large class of operator complexity measures, including the out-of-time-order correlator. As a result, we obtain a sharp bound on Lyapunov exponents $\lambda_L \leq 2 \alpha$, which complements and improves the known universal low-temperature bound $\lambda_L \leq 2 \pi T$. We illustrate our results in paradigmatic examples such as non-integrable spin chains, the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, and classical models.

The robustness of error correction by a quantum code is upper bounded by the ""mutual purity"" of a certain entangled state between the code subspace and environment in the isometric extension of the error channel, where the mutual purity of a density matrix $\rho_{AB}$ is the difference $\mathcal{F}_\rho (A:B) \equiv \mathrm{Tr}\;\rho_{AB}^2 - \mathrm{Tr}\;\rho_A^2\;\mathrm{Tr}\;\rho_B^2$. We show that when the encoding complexity is small, the mutual purity is $O(1)$ for the erasure of a small number of qubits (i.e., the encoding is fragile). However, this quantity decays exponentially, becoming $O(1/N)$ for $O(\log N)$ encoding complexity. Further, at polynomial encoding complexity, the mutual purity saturates to a plateau of $O(e^{-N})$. We also find a hierarchy of complexity scales associated to a tower of subleading contributions to the mutual purity that quantitatively, but not qualitatively, adjust our error correction bound as encoding complexity increases. In the AdS/CFT context, our results suggest that any portion of the entanglement wedge of a general boundary subregion $A$ with sufficiently high encoding complexity is robustly protected against low-rank errors acting on $A$ with no prior access to the encoding map.

First, understanding heat and other types of noise is essential for protecting quantum information and preventing decoherence. Second, the ability to manufacture and control quantum systems developed for the quantum computer allows for experimental study of quantum thermodynamics in entirely new settings. In this thesis, several systems involving quantum systems in contact with baths are studied theoretically in experimentally available settings. First, two rectification or diode setups for heat currents are proposed using a dark-state mechanism. In one system, the dark-state mechanism is imperfect but very robust. In the other system, the dark-state mechanism relies on quantum entanglement and is much better but more fragile towards decoherence. Next, a quantum version of the Wheatstone bridge is built using the same entanglement-powered dark state mechanism. After having studied several boundary-driven quantum systems, the lessons learned are generalized into resonance conditions using a general linear chain of weakly interacting chains of strongly interacting spins. The final two chapters focus on the ability to study statistical physics in realizable quantum systems. First, a Maxwell's demon setup is proposed. A demon-controlled qutrit is coupled to two non-Markovian baths. The information back-flow from the non-Markovian baths allows the demon to more effectively transfer heat from the cold bath to the hot bath. Second, the Mott insulator to superfluid phase transition in a lattice of transmons is examined. The ground state has a variable particle number and is prepared using adiabatic state preparation.

To extract large quantities of energy one needs to mount a recursive Penrose process where particles are confined and can bounce back to suffer ever again a decaying process in the black hole electric ergoregion. In an asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, two situations of confinement are possible. One situation uses a reflecting mirror at some radius, which obliges the energetic outgoing particles to return to the decaying point. The other situation uses the natural AdS property that sends back at some intrinsic returning radius those outgoing energetic particles. In addition, besides the conservation laws the decaying process must obey, one has to set conditions at the decaying point for the particles debris. These conditions restrain the possible scenarios, but there are still a great number of available scenarios for the decays. Within these, we choose two scenarios, scenario 1 and scenario 2, that pertain to the masses and electric charges of the final particles. Thus, in the mirror situation we find that scenario 1 leads to a black hole energy factory, and scenario 2 ends in a black hole bomb. In the no mirror situation, i.e., pure Reissner-Nordström-AdS, scenario 1 leads again to a black hole energy factory, but scenario 2 yields no bomb. This happens because the volume in which the particles are confined increases to infinity along the chain of decays, leading to a zero value of the extracted energy per unit volume and the bomb is demined. The whole treatment performed here involves no backreaction on the black hole mass and electric charge, nevertheless we speculate that the end state of the recursive process is a Reissner-Nordström-AdS black hole with very short hair, i.e., with one particle at rest at some definite radius.","2024-01-23","2024-01-25 08:35:54","2024-02-18 13:40:11","2024-01-25 08:35:54","","","","","","arXiv:2401.13039 [gr-qc]","Penrose process in Reissner-Nordstr\""om-AdS black hole spacetimes","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2751007","arXiv.org","","1 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 1 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) arXiv:2401.13039 [gr-qc] Citation Key: Feiteira:2024awb","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/B67MY7IU/Feiteira2024awb.pdf","","","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena; General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology; High Energy Physics - Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Part of the statement is that the off-diagonal elements fall exponential for large energy difference. We propose that the exponent ($\gamma>0$) is a measure of quantum chaos. Smaller $\gamma$ implies more chaotic dynamics. The chaos bound is given by $\gamma=\beta/4$ where $\beta$ is the inverse temperature. We give analytical argument in support of this proposal. The slower exponential fall also means that the action of the operator on a state leads to higher delocalization in energy eigenbasis. Numerically we compare two chaotic Hamiltonians - SYK model and chaotic XXZ spin chain. Using the new measure, we find that the SYK model becomes maximally chaotic at low temperature which has been shown rigorously in previous works. The new measure is more readily accessible compare to other measures using numerical methods.","2024-01-24","2024-01-25 08:35:44","2024-01-25 08:35:45","2024-01-25 08:35:43","","","","","","arXiv:2401.13633 [quant-ph]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2750975","arXiv.org","","0 citations (INSPIRE 2024/1/25) 0 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/1/25) arXiv:2401.13633 [quant-ph] Citation Key: Sorokhaibam:2024fcv","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/EBA9PF5T/Sorokhaibam2024fcv.pdf","","","Condensed Matter - Statistical Mechanics; High Energy Physics - Theory; Quantum Physics; Nonlinear Sciences - Chaotic Dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent experiments showing an unexpected linear-in-field, $B$, magnetoresistivity have deepened the puzzle. We propose a simple model of itinerant electrons, interacting via random couplings with electrons localized on a lattice of quantum 'dots' or 'islands'. This model is solvable in a large-$N$ limit, and can reproduce observed behavior. The key feature of our model is that the electrons in each quantum dot are described by a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model describing electrons without quasiparticle excitations. For a particular choice of the interaction between the itinerant and localized electrons, this model realizes a controlled description of a diffusive marginal-Fermi liquid (MFL) without momentum conservation, which has a linear-in-$T$ resistivity and a $T \ln T$ specific heat as $T\rightarrow 0$. By tuning the strength of this interaction relative to the bandwidth of the itinerant electrons, we can additionally obtain a finite-$T$ crossover to a fully incoherent regime that also has a linear-in-$T$ resistivity. We show that the MFL regime has conductivities which scale as a function of $B/T$; however, its magnetoresistance saturates at large $B$. We then consider a macroscopically disordered sample with domains of MFLs with varying densities of electrons. Using an effective-medium approximation, we obtain a macroscopic electrical resistance that scales linearly in the magnetic field $B$ applied perpendicular to the plane of the sample, at large $B$. The resistance also scales linearly in $T$ at small $B$, and as $T f(B/T)$ at intermediate $B$. We consider implications for recent experiments reporting linear transverse magnetoresistance in the strange metal phases of the pnictides and cuprates.","2018-05-23","2024-01-19 13:35:32","2024-01-19 13:35:33","2024-01-19 13:35:32","021049","","2","8","","Phys.

To probe these quantum corrections, we study electromagnetic and gravitational (axial) perturbations on this background, and derive the coupled system of Regge-Wheeler master equations that govern the propagation of these waves.

It is one of the tools to diagnose quantum chaos and unravel the universal dynamics therein. The definition of SFF in most literature only encapsulates the two-level correlation. In this manuscript, we extend the definition of SSF to include the high-order correlation. Specifically, we introduce the standard deviation of energy levels to define correlation functions, from which the generalized spectral form factor (GSFF) can be obtained by Fourier transforms. GSFF provides a more comprehensive knowledge of the dynamics of chaotic systems. Using random matrices as examples, we demonstrate new dynamics features that are encoded in GSFF. Remarkably, the GSFF is complex, and both the real and imaginary parts exhibit universal dynamics.

The spectral form factor corresponds to the Fourier transform of the two-point spectral correlation function and exhibits a typical slope-dip-ramp-plateau structure (aka correlation hole) when the system is chaotic. We discuss how this structure could be detected through the dynamics of two physical quantities accessible to experimental many-body quantum systems: the survival probability and the spin autocorrelation function.

We consider an extension of the standard diagnostics of quantum chaos, namely the complex level spacing ratio and out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), to study the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum kicked rotor model. The kicked rotor has long been regarded as a paradigmatic dynamic system to study classical and quantum chaos. By introducing non-Hermiticity in the quantum kicked rotor, we uncover new phases and transitions that are absent in the Hermitian system. From the study of the complex level spacing ratio, we locate three regimes -- one which is integrable and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, another which is chaotic with $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry and a third which is chaotic but with broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry. We find that the complex level spacing ratio can distinguish between all three phases. Since calculations of the OTOC can be related to those of the classical Lyapunov exponent in the semi-classical limit, we investigate its nature in these regimes and at the phase boundaries. In the phases with $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, the OTOC exhibits behaviour akin to what is observed in the Hermitian system in both the integrable and chaotic regimes. Moreover, in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken phase, the OTOC demonstrates additional exponential growth stemming from the complex nature of the eigenvalue spectrum at later times. We derive the analytical form of the late-time behaviour of the OTOC. By defining a normalized OTOC to mitigate the effects caused by $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking, we show that the OTOC exhibits singular behaviour at the transition from the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric chaotic phase to the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken, chaotic phase.","2024-01-14","2024-01-19 08:44:05","2024-01-19 08:44:06","2024-01-19 08:44:05","","","","","","arXiv:2401.07215 [quant-ph]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2747262","arXiv.org","","0 citations (INSPIRE 2024/1/19) 0 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/1/19) arXiv:2401.07215 [quant-ph] Citation Key: Sharma:2024fqc","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/FD37IVVJ/Sharma2024fqc.pdf","","","Quantum Physics; Condensed Matter - Other Condensed Matter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, by exploiting the structure of entanglement wedge reconstruction we argue that the bulk counterpart has a non-topological worldvolume action, i.e., it describes a dynamical object. As a consequence, we find that there are no global $p$-form symmetries for $p \geq 0$ in asymptotically AdS spacetimes, which includes the case of non-invertible symmetries. Provided one has a suitable notion of subregion-subregion duality, our argument for the absence of bulk global symmetries applies to more general spacetimes.

These are deterministic classical many-body dynamical systems which can be interpreted in terms of symplectic dynamics in two orthogonal (time and space) directions. In close analogy with quantum dual-unitary circuits, we prove that two-point dynamical correlation functions are non-vanishing only along the edges of the light cones. The dynamical correlations are exactly computable in terms of a one-site Markov transfer operator, which is generally of infinite dimensionality. We test our theory in a specific family of dual-symplectic circuits, describing the dynamics of a classical Floquet spin chain.

Keeping in mind the gauge/gravity duality framework, the non-conformality in the dual field theory has been introduced by considering a Liouville type dilaton potential for the gravitational theory. The resulting black brane solution is associated with a parameter $\eta$ which represents the deviation from conformality. The parameters of chaos, namely, the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity are computed by following the well-known shock wave analysis. The obtained results reveal that presence of non-conformality leads to suppression of the chaotic nature of a system. Further, for a particular value of the nonconformal parameter $\eta$, the system achieves Lyapunov stability resulting from the vanishing of both Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity. Interestingly, this particular value of $\eta$ matches with the previously given upper bound of $\eta$. The effects of chaos and non-conformality on the existing correlation of a thermofield doublet state have been quantified by holographically computing the two-sided mutual information in both the presence and absence of the shock wave. Furthermore, the entanglement velocity is also computed and the effect of non-conformality on it have been observed. Finally, the obtained results of Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity have also been verified from the pole-skipping analysis.","2024-01-11","2024-01-14 17:14:08","2024-01-14 17:14:09","2024-01-14 17:14:08","","","","","","arXiv:2401.05814 [hep-th]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2745667","arXiv.org","","0 citations (INSPIRE 2024/1/14) 0 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/1/14) arXiv:2401.05814 [hep-th] Citation Key: Saha:2024bpt","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/VRGWSXDK/Saha2024bpt.pdf","","","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology; High Energy Physics - Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The disclination and dislocation crystal defects, respectively, map onto charges and dipoles of the fracton gauge theory. This fracton-elasticity duality leads to predictions of fractonic phases and quantum phase transitions to their descendants that are duals of the commensurate crystal, supersolid, smectic, and hexatic liquid crystals, as well as amorphous solids, quasicrystals, and elastic membranes. It is shown how these dual gauge theories provide a field-theoretic description of quantum melting transitions through a generalized Higgs mechanism.

We extend these ideas to cases where the background geometry is non-AdS, and the gravity description of the dual confining field theory has a top-down origin in supergravity. We exemplify this programme by studying the circle compactification of Romans six-dimensional half-maximal supergravity. We uncover a rich space of solutions, many of which were previously unknown in the literature. We compute the bosonic spectrum of excitations, and identify a tachyonic instability in a region of parameter space for a class of regular background solutions. A tachyon only exists along an energetically disfavoured (unphysical) branch of solutions of the gravity theory; we find evidence of a first-order phase transition that separates this region of parameter space from the physical one. Along the physical branch of regular solutions, one of the lightest scalar particles is approximately a dilaton, and it is associated with a condensate in the underlying theory.

Two subjects are presented in the manuscript, both aiming at studying the effect of the spin of elementary particles on otherwise known theories. First is a study of the L\'evy-Leblond-Newton (LLN) equation, which is used to describe the evolution of a quantum system with spin 1/2 that is coupled to its own gravitational potential. After reviewing some symmetries of non relativistic Quantum Mechanics, and how to geometrize them with the help of Bargmann structures, we recall what is the L\'evy-Leblond equation. In this chapter, the LLN equation is described in a fully covariant way on Bargmann structures. This covariant formulation then helps to derive the dynamical symmetries of the equation, and conserved quantities. The symmetry group of this equation turns out to be the already known Schr\""odinger-Newton group. The second part deals with the trajectory of particles with spin in General Relativity. We first highlight Souriau's geometric method to derive the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) equations, and then discuss the different possible Spin Supplementary Conditions (SSC) that exist to close the system of MPD equations. In this chapter, we assume the Tulczyjew SSC to describe the trajectory of photons, leading to the Souriau-Saturnini equations. We then present some works where we have applied these equations, in a Schwarzschild spacetime, and in a spacetime deformed by a gravitational wave. In the first work, we found gravitational birefringence: the trajectory deviates from the geodesic plane, depending on the helicity of the photon and its wavelength. The second work presented also found birefringence in gravitational interferometry experiments, however the effect is many orders of magnitude lower than what we can detect.","2020-12-03","2021-04-02 16:14:42","2023-10-09 07:42:48","2021-04-02 16:14:41","","","","","","arXiv:2103.17074 [gr-qc]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1854747","arXiv.org","","0 citations (INSPIRE 2022/6/24) 0 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2022/6/24) arXiv:2103.17074 [gr-qc] Citation Key: Marsot:2020iko","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/PHTLD5FF/Marsot2020iko.pdf","","","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology; Mathematical Physics; ⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Second, it introduces and compares two proposals for gravitational energy and momentum, one of which is very influential in physics: and, so far as I know, neither of the two has been discussed in the philosophical literature. Third, it assesses these proposals in connection with recent philosophical discussions of energy and momentum in general relativity. After briefly reviewing the debates about energy conservation between Hilbert, Klein, Noether and Einstein, I give Noether's two theorems. I show that Einstein's gravitational energy-momentum pseudo-tensor, including its superpotential, is fixed, through Noether's theorem, by the boundary terms in the action. That is, the freedom to add an arbitrary superpotential to the gravitational pseudo-tensor corresponds to the freedom to add boundary terms to the action without changing the equations of motion. This freedom is fixed in the same way for both problems. I also review two proposals for energy and momentum in GR, of which one is a quasi-local alternative to the local expressions, and the other builds on Einstein's local pseudo-tensor approach. I discuss the recent philosophical literature on the conservation of energy and momentum in general relativity, and I assess and compare the two proposals in the light of this literature: especially, in light of questions about diffeomorphism invariance and background-independence.","2021-03-31","2021-04-02 16:14:46","2024-02-18 13:41:38","2021-04-02 16:14:46","","","","","","arXiv:2103.17160 [physics.hist-ph]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1854790","arXiv.org","","12 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 12 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) arXiv:2103.17160 [physics.hist-ph] Citation Key: DeHaro:2021gdv","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/2VG3QLPG/DeHaro2021gdv.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology; Physics - History and Philosophy of Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The fundamental shell can exist in three states, nonextremal, extremal, and overcharged. The nonextremal state allows the shell to be located such that its radius can be outside its own gravitational radius, or can be inside its own Cauchy radius. The extremal state allows the shell to be located such that its radius can be outside its own gravitational radius, or can be inside it. The overcharged state allows the shell to be located anywhere. There is a further division, one has to specify the orientation of the shell, i.e., whether the normal out of the shell points toward increasing or decreasing radii. There is still a subdivision in the extremal state when the shell is at the gravitational radius, in that the shell can approach it from above or from below. The shell is assumed to be composed of an electrically charged perfect fluid, and the energy conditions are tested. Carter-Penrose diagrams are drawn for the shell spacetimes.

At the continuous Ising transition, we identify scaling behavior in the classification accuracy, from which we infer a characteristic classification length scale. It displays a power-law divergence at the critical point, with a scaling exponent that matches with the diverging correlation length. Our algorithm correctly identifies the thermodynamic phase of the system and extracts scaling behavior from projective measurements, independently of the basis in which the measurements are performed. Furthermore, we show the classification length scale is absent for the $q=6$ Potts model, which has a first order transition and thus lacks a divergent correlation length. The main intuition underlying our finding is that, for measurement patches of sizes smaller than the correlation length, the system appears to be at the critical point, and therefore the algorithm cannot identify the phase from which the data was drawn.","2022-05-09","2021-04-02 16:16:04","2024-02-18 13:41:19","2021-04-02 16:16:04","L022032","","2","4","","Phys.

Considering the physical process of measurement within a thermodynamic context naturally raises the following question: How can the work and heat be interpreted? In the present paper we model the measurement process for an arbitrary discrete observable as a measurement scheme. Here the system to be measured is first unitarily coupled with an apparatus and subsequently the compound system is objectified with respect to a pointer observable, thus producing definite measurement outcomes. The work can therefore be interpreted as the change in internal energy of the compound system due to the unitary coupling. By the first law of thermodynamics, the heat is the subsequent change in internal energy of this compound due to pointer objectification. We argue that the apparatus serves as a stable record for the measurement outcomes only if the pointer observable commutes with the Hamiltonian and show that such commutativity implies that the uncertainty of heat will necessarily be classical.","2021-12-08","2021-04-02 16:17:19","2024-02-18 13:41:28","2021-04-02 16:17:19","062202","","6","104","","Phys.

Phys. A: Math. Theor. 53, 115303 (2020)], we have introduced a set of noncommutative algebra that describes the space-time at the Planck scale. The interesting significant result we found is that the generalized uncertainty principle induced a maximal length of quantum gravity which has different physical implications to the one of generalized uncertainty principle with minimal length. The emergence of a maximal length in this theory revealed strong quantum gravitational effects at this scale and predicted the detection of gravity particles with low energies. To make evidence of these predictions, we study the dynamics of a free particle confined in an infinite square well potential in one dimension of this space. Since the effects of quantum gravity are strong in this space, we show that the energy spectrum of this system is weakly proportional to the ordinary one of quantum mechanics free of the theory of gravity. The states of this particle exhibit proprieties similar to the standard coherent states which are consequences of quantum fluctuation at this scale. Then, with the spectrum of this system at hand, we analyze the thermodynamic quantities within the canonical and microcanonical ensembles of an ideal gas made up of $N$ indistinguishable particles at the Planck scale. The results show a complete consistency between both statistical descriptions. Furthermore, a comparison with the results obtained in the context of minimal length scenarios and black hole theories indicates that the maximal length in this theory induces logarithmic corrections of deformed parameters which are consequences of a strong quantum gravitational effect.","2021-03-26","2021-04-02 16:17:23","2023-10-09 07:42:36","2021-04-02 16:17:23","","","","","","arXiv:2103.00089 [hep-th]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1849302","arXiv.org","","1 citations (INSPIRE 2022/6/24) 1 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2022/6/24) arXiv:2103.00089 [hep-th] Citation Key: Lawson:2021rgs","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/RN9TSK2J/Lawson2021rgs.pdf","","","High Energy Physics - Theory; Quantum Physics; Mathematical Physics; ⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within this system, the oddness of the non-conformal vacuum and non-primary operator is elucidated.

Here, the dynamics of both the dual order-parameter field and the metric tensor field originate from density-density and energy-momentum tensor-tensor effective interactions, respectively, in the recursive renormalization group transformation, performed approximately in the Gaussian level. This linear approximation in the recursive renormalization group transformation for the gravity sector gives rise to a linearized quantum Einstein-scalar theory along the $z-$directional emergent space. In the large $N$ limit, where $N$ is the flavor number of the original scalar fields, quantum fluctuations of both dynamical metric and dual scalar fields are suppressed, leading to a classical field theory of the Einstein-scalar type in $(D+1)$-spacetime dimensions. We show that this emergent background gravity describes the renormalization group flows of coupling functions in the UV quantum field theory through the extra dimension. More precisely, the IR boundary conditions of the gravity equations correspond to the renormalization group $\beta$-functions of the quantum field theory, where the infinitesimal distance in the extra-dimensional space is identified with an energy scale for the renormalization group transformation. Finally, we also show that this dual holographic formulation describes quantum entanglement in a geometrical way, encoding the transfer of quantum entanglement from quantum matter to classical gravity in the large $N$ limit.

We employ random couplings in flavor space between the fermions and the bosonic order parameter, but there is no spatial randomness: consequently, the $G$-$\Sigma$ path integral of the theory is expressed in terms of fields bilocal in spacetime. The critical exponents of the large $N$ saddle-point are the same as in the well-studied non-random RPA theory; in particular, the entropy density vanishes in the limit of zero temperature. We present a full numerical solution of the large $N$ saddle-point equations, and the results agree with the critical behavior obtained analytically. Following analyses of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models, we describe scaling operators which descend from fermion bilinears around the Fermi surface. This leads to a systematic consideration of the role of time reparameterization symmetry, and the scaling of the Cooper pairing and $2k_F$ operators which can determine associated instabilities of the critical Fermi surface.

A generalized, self-consistent Hamiltonian was therefore constructed for an arbitrary quantum-mechanical system in a way that the ground-state Hamiltonian turned out to be just a limiting case at absolute zero. The weak-coupling term connecting the system of interest and its immediate environment was accordingly treated as the perturbation. Applying the obtained generalized Hamiltonian to some typical quantum systems with exact zero-temperature solutions, including the free particle in a box, the free particle in vacuum, and the harmonic oscillator, up to the first order of self-consistency, therefore corrected their associated Hamiltonians, energy spectrums, and wavefunctions to be consistent with the low-temperature limit. Further investigation revealed some kind of quantum tunneling effect by a residual probability for the free particle in a box, as a chief consequence of thermally coupling to the reservoir. The possible effects of thermal environment on the main properties of the wavefunctions were also thoroughly examined and discussed.","2021-03-04","2021-04-02 16:19:43","2023-10-09 07:42:16","2021-04-02 16:19:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 2103.03306","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/22GB78YL/shekaari2021.pdf","","","⛔ No INSPIRE recid found; Condensed Matter - Statistical Mechanics; Quantum Physics; ⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The interest comes from the fact that Black-Hole models seem to saturate all of them. The goal of this work is to gain physical intuition about the quantum mechanisms that enforce these bounds on simple models. To this aim, we consider classical and quantum free dynamics on curved manifolds. These systems exhibit chaos up to the lowest temperatures and - as we discuss - they violate the bounds in the classical limit. First of all, we show that the quantum dimensionless viscosity and the Lyapunov exponent only depend on the de Broglie length and a geometric length-scale, thus establishing the scale at which quantum effects become relevant. Then, we focus on the bound on the Lyapunov exponent and identify three different ways in which quantum effects arise in practice. We illustrate our findings on a toy model given by the surface of constant negative curvature - a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos - glued to a cylinder. By exact solution and numerical investigations, we show how the chaotic behaviour is limited by the quantum effects of the curvature itself. Interestingly, we find that at the lowest energies the bound to chaos is dominated by the longest length scales, and it is therefore a collective effect.","2022-07-22","2021-06-28 07:30:29","2024-02-18 13:41:15","2021-06-28 07:30:29","006","","1","13","","SciPost Phys.","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1870340","arXiv.org","","8 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 6 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) arXiv:2106.13269 [hep-th] Citation Key: Pappalardi:2021rwt","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/63FXYTEG/Pappalardi2021rwt.pdf","","","Condensed Matter - Statistical Mechanics; High Energy Physics - Theory; Quantum Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Measuring the dynamic charge response of the copper-oxides, $\chi''(q,\omega)$, would directly reveal the collective properties of the strange metal, but it has never been possible to measure this quantity with meV resolution. Here, we present the first measurement of $\chi''(q,\omega)$ for a cuprate, optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ ($T_c=91$ K), using momentum-resolved inelastic electron scattering. In the medium energy range 0.1-2 eV relevant to the strange metal, the spectra are dominated by a featureless, temperature- and momentum-independent continuum persisting to the eV energy scale. This continuum displays a simple power law form, exhibiting $q^2$ behavior at low energy and $q^2/\omega^2$ behavior at high energy. Measurements of an overdoped crystal ($T_c=50$ K) showed the emergence of a gap-like feature at low temperature, indicating deviation from power law form outside the strange metal regime.

The energies and momenta of the primary operator states are needed to determine the primary operator scaling dimensions and conformal spins -- an essential part of the conformal data that specifies the CFT.

Identifying the origin of these collective anomalies has proved profoundly challenging, even in materials such as the hole-doped cuprates that possess a simple band structure. The prevailing dogma is that strange metallicity in the cuprates is tied to a quantum critical point at a doping $p*$ inside the superconducting dome. Here, we study the high-field in-plane magnetoresistance of two superconducting cuprate families at doping levels beyond $p*$. At all dopings, the magnetoresistance exhibits quadrature scaling and becomes linear at high $H/T$ ratios. Moreover, its magnitude is found to be much larger than predicted by conventional theory and insensitive to both impurity scattering and magnetic field orientation. These observations, coupled with analysis of the zero-field and Hall resistivities, suggest that despite having a single band, the cuprate strange metal phase hosts two charge sectors, one containing coherent quasiparticles, the other scale-invariant `Planckian' dissipators.","2021-07-29","2022-05-10 09:19:56","2024-02-18 13:41:30","2022-05-10 09:19:56","661-666","","7869","595","","Nature","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","56 citations (CrossRef 2024/2/18) arXiv: 2012.01208","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/2SSXY6FA/ayres2021.pdf","","","⛔ No INSPIRE recid found; Condensed Matter - Strongly Correlated Electrons; Condensed Matter - Superconductivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we study the dynamical process of the spontaneous scalarization of charged black hole in asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar models. Including various non-minimal couplings between the scalar field and Maxwell field, we observe that an initial scalar-free configuration suffers tachyonic instability and both the scalar field and the black hole irreducible mass grow exponentially at early times and saturate exponentially at late times. For fractional couplings, we find that though there is negative energy distribution near the black hole horizon, the black hole horizon area never decreases. But when the parameters are large, the evolution endpoints of linearly unstable bald black holes will be spacetimes with naked singularity and the cosmic censorship is violated. The effects of the black hole charge, cosmological constant and coupling strength on the dynamical scalarization process are studied in detail.

For this reason, the job of testing the stability of states that are not Lorentz-invariant can be very cumbersome. We show that two observers can disagree on whether a state is stable or unstable only if the perturbations can exit the light-cone. Furthermore, we show that, if a perturbation exits the light-cone, and its intensity changes with time, due to dissipation, then there are always two observers that disagree on the stability of the state. Hence, ''stability'' is a Lorentz-invariant property of dissipative theories if and only if the principle of causality is respected.

The review is placed in the context of numerous experimental observations on correlated electron materials. Strong correlations in metals are often associated with their proximity to a Mott transition to an insulator created by the local Coulomb repulsion between the electrons. We explore the phase diagrams of a number of models of such local electronic correlation, employing a dynamical mean field theory in the presence of random spin exchange interactions. Numerical analyses and analytical solutions, using renormalization group methods and expansions in large spin degeneracy, lead to critical regions which display SYK physics. The models studied include the single-band Hubbard model, the $t$-$J$ model and the two-band Kondo-Heisenberg model in the presence of random spin exchange interactions. We also examine non-Fermi liquids obtained by considering each SYK model with random four-fermion interactions to be a multi-orbital atom, with the SYK-atoms arranged in an infinite lattice. We connect to theories of sharp Fermi surfaces without any low-energy quasiparticles in the absence of spatial disorder, obtained by coupling a Fermi liquid to a gapless boson; a systematic large $N$ theory of such a critical Fermi surface, with SYK characteristics, is obtained by averaging over an ensemble of theories with random boson-fermion couplings. Finally, we present an overview of the links between the SYK model and quantum gravity and end with an outlook on open questions.","2022-07-01","2022-06-24 16:46:21","2024-02-18 13:41:17","2022-06-24 16:46:21","035004","","3","94","","Rev.

Finally, we study the pseudo-Goldstone mode that emerges upon introducing a perturbative symmetry breaking source and we determine its resonant frequency and decay rate.","2021-09-21","2022-06-29 07:39:43","2024-02-18 13:41:30","2022-06-29 07:39:43","134","","9","09","","JHEP","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1879738","arXiv.org","","23 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 18 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) arXiv:2107.03680 [hep-th] Citation Key: Donos:2021pkk","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/S5RK34RL/Donos2021pkk.pdf","","","High Energy Physics - Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use and are surrounded by glass objects which make tangible the reality of glass as a distinct state of matter. Yet, glass as we know it is usually obtained by cooling a liquid sufficiently rapidly below its melting point to avoid crystallisation. The viscosity of this supercooled liquid increases by many orders of magnitude upon cooling, until the liquid becomes essentially arrested on experimental timescales below the ``glass transition'' temperature. From a structural viewpoint, the obtained glass still very much resembles the disordered liquid, but from a mechanical viewpoint, it is as rigid as an ordered crystal. Does glass qualify as a separate state of matter? We provide a pedagogical perspective on this question using basic statistical mechanical concepts. We recall the definitions of states of matter and of phase transitions between them. We review recent theoretical results suggesting why and how an ``ideal glass'' can indeed be defined as a separate equilibrium state of matter. We discuss recent success of computer simulations trying to analyse this glass state.

In the first part, ETH is introduced as a natural extension of ideas from quantum chaos and random matrix theory (RMT). To this end, we present a brief overview of classical and quantum chaos, as well as RMT and some of its most important predictions. The latter include the statistics of energy levels, eigenstate components, and matrix elements of observables. Building on these, we introduce the ETH and show that it allows one to describe thermalization in isolated chaotic systems without invoking the notion of an external bath. We examine numerical evidence of eigenstate thermalization from studies of many-body lattice systems. We also introduce the concept of a quench as a means of taking isolated systems out of equilibrium, and discuss results of numerical experiments on quantum quenches. The second part of the review explores the implications of quantum chaos and ETH to thermodynamics. Basic thermodynamic relations are derived, including the second law of thermodynamics, the fundamental thermodynamic relation, fluctuation theorems, and the Einstein and Onsager relations. In particular, it is shown that quantum chaos allows one to prove these relations for individual Hamiltonian eigenstates and thus extend them to arbitrary stationary statistical ensembles. We then show how one can use these relations to obtain nontrivial universal energy distributions in continuously driven systems. At the end of the review, we briefly discuss the relaxation dynamics and description after relaxation of integrable quantum systems, for which ETH is violated. We introduce the concept of the generalized Gibbs ensemble, and discuss its connection with ideas of prethermalization in weakly interacting systems.","2016-07-31","2022-10-27 08:37:05","2024-02-18 13:42:22","2022-10-27 08:37:04","239-362","","3","65","","Adv.

We then study two algorithms, Ricci-flow and Newton's method, for solving the resulting Einstein-DeTurck equation. We illustrate the use of these methods by studying localized black holes and non-uniform black strings in five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory, improving on previous calculations of their thermodynamic and geometric properties. We study spectra of various operators for these solutions, in particular finding negative modes of the Lichnerowicz operator. We classify the localized solutions into two branches that meet at a minimum temperature. We find good evidence for a merger between the localized and non-uniform solutions. We also find a narrow window of localized solutions that possess negative modes yet appear to have positive specific heat.","2010","2022-10-27 08:45:43","2024-02-18 13:42:44","2022-10-27 08:45:42","035002","","3","27","","Class.

First, we consider correlation functions of descendant states in two-dimensional CFTs. We discuss a recursive formula to calculate them and provide a computer implementation of it. This allows us to obtain any correlation function of vacuum descendants, and for non-vacuum descendants to express the correlator as a differential operator acting on the respective primary correlator. With this code, we study some entanglement and distinguishability measures between descendant states, i.e. the Rényi entropy, trace square distance and sandwiched Rényi divergence. With our results we can test the Rényi Quantum Null Energy Condition and provide new tools to analyse the holographic description of descendant states. Second, we study four-dimensional Weyl fermions on different backgrounds. Our interest is in their trace anomaly, where the Pontryagin density has been claimed to appear. To ascertain this possibility, we compute the anomalies of Dirac fermions coupled to vector and axial non-abelian gauge fields and then in a metric-axial-tensor background. Appropriate limits of the backgrounds allow to recover the anomalies of Weyl fermions coupled to non-abelian gauge fields and in a curved spacetime. In both cases we confirm the absence of the Pontryagin density in the trace anomalies. Third, we provide the holographic description of a four-dimensional CFT with an irrelevant operator. When the operator has integer conformal dimension, its presence in the CFT modifies the Weyl transformation of the metric, which in turns modifies the trace anomaly. Exploiting the equivalence between bulk diffeomorphisms and boundary Weyl transformations, we compute these modifications from the dual gravity theory. Our results represent an additional test of the AdS/CFT conjecture.","2022-12-20","2022-12-23 09:35:42","2023-10-09 07:40:43","2022-12-23 09:35:42","","","","","","arXiv:2212.11829 [hep-th]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2616630","arXiv.org","","0 citations (INSPIRE 2022/12/23) 0 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2022/12/23) arXiv:2212.11829 [hep-th] Citation Key: Broccoli:2022klu","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/7PJ44BFH/Broccoli2022klu.pdf","","","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology; High Energy Physics - Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within the Kubo formalism, the resistivity is approximately linear in temperature with a Drude form for the optical conductivity, such that the Drude lifetime is inversely proportional to the temperature. Additionally, when the bosons emerge from electron pairs with spin-triplet symmetry, the magnetoresistance has a linear magnetic field dependence. Here, we compute the transport properties of such bosons within the memory-matrix approach that successfully captures the hydrodynamic regime. This technique emerges as the appropriate framework for describing the transport coefficients of the strange metal phase.

They represent special quantum spaces and are thus strongly related to noncommutative geometry. In order to establish a semiclassical limit that allows to extract their intuitive geometrical content, this thesis analyzes and refines an approach that associates a classical geometry to a given matrix configuration, based on quasi-coherent states. While, so far, the approach is only well understood for very specific cases, in this work it is reviewed and implemented on a computer, allowing the numerical investigation of deformations of these cases. It is proven that the classical space can be made into a smooth manifold immersed into complex projective space. Further, the necessity for the consideration of foliations thereof is shown in order to deal with the observed and subsequently described phenomenon called oxidation. The developed numerical methods allow the visualization of the semiclassical limit as well as quantitative calculations. Explicit examples suggest the stability under perturbations of the refined approach and highlight the physical interpretation of the construction. All this supports a better understanding of the geometrical content of arbitrary matrix configurations as well as their classical interpretation and establishes the determination of important quantities.","2023-01-20","2023-01-25 10:02:33","2023-10-09 07:40:35","2023-01-25 10:02:33","","","","","","arXiv:2301.10206 [hep-th]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2626064","arXiv.org","","1 citations (INSPIRE 2023/8/4) 0 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2023/8/4) arXiv:2301.10206 [hep-th] Citation Key: Felder:2023qhv","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/DGJW369K/Felder2023qhv.pdf","","","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology; High Energy Physics - Theory; Mathematical Physics; ⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A normal state at a QCP is a non-Fermi liquid with no coherent quasiparticles. A superconducting order gaps out low-energy excitations, except for a sliver of states for non-s-wave gap symmetry, and at a first glance, should restore a coherent quasiparticle behavior. We argue that this does not necessarily hold as in some cases the fermionic self-energy remains singular slightly above the gap edge. This singularity gives rise to markedly non-BCS behavior of the density of states and to broadening and eventual vanishing of the quasiparticle peak in the spectral function. We analyze the set of quantum-critical models with an effective dynamical 4-fermion interaction, mediated by a gapless boson at a QCP, $V(\Omega) \propto 1/\Omega^\gamma$.

However, we also demonstrate that for Gaussian states, classical analogs can be used to obtain the same mathematical results, providing a valuable tool for simplifying calculations. To establish the groundwork for the subsequent analysis, we introduce some fundamental ideas from quantum field theory. We then explore the structure of parameter space using the fidelity and the Quantum Geometric Tensor (QGT), which is composed of the Quantum Metric Tensor and the Berry curvature. We also introduce the Quantum Covariance Matrix (QCM) and show its relationship to the QGT. We present how the QCM can be used to study entanglement between quantum systems by obtaining the purity, linear entropy, and von Neumann entropy. To illustrate these concepts, we calculate all these quantities for several systems, including the Stern-Gerlach, a two qubits system, two symmetrically coupled harmonic oscillators, and N coupled harmonic oscillators. In the final section of this thesis, we examine how the aforementioned quantum concepts can be applied in a classical sense, following the approach taken by Hannay with the Berry phase. We examine classical analogs of the QGT and QCM and since for Gaussian states, all the necessary information to calculate purity, linear entropy, and von Neumann entropy is contained within the QCM, we also generate classical analogs for them.

Each approach emphasizes specific aspects of the theory overlooked by the other methods. Extensions of the RPA secular equations to treat the continuum part of the excitation spectrum and also the pairing between the particles composing the system are presented.

Moreover, Lieb-Robinson bounds have been extended in non-trivial ways, to demonstrate speed limits in systems with power-law interactions or interacting bosons, and even to prove notions of locality that arise in cartoon models for quantum gravity with all-to-all interactions.

Subsequently, some elements of the quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional (2D) gapped (""incompressible"") electron liquids are reviewed. In particular, I discuss the role of anomalous chiral edge currents and of anomaly inflow in 2D gapped electron liquids with explicitly or spontaneously broken time reversal, i.e., in Hall- and Chern insulators. The topological Chern-Simons action yielding the transport equations valid in the bulk of such systems and the associated anomalous edge action are derived. The results of a general classification of ""abelian"" Hall insulators are outlined. After some remarks on induced Chern-Simons actions, I sketch results on certain 2D chiral photonic wave guides.

The current approach, symmetry-invariant perturbation theory is a first principles method with no adjustable parameters. An adiabatic evolution is employed to transfer the well-known Pauli restrictions for identical, independent particles with two spin values to restrictions on the collective modes of an ensemble of ``spin up''``spin down'' particles. The collective modes, analytic N-body normal modes, are obtained from a group theoretic exact solution of the first-order equations. Cooper pairing is reinterpreted not as the pairing of two fermions with total zero momentum, but as the convergence of the momentum of the entire ensemble to two values, +k and -k, as the particles in the normal mode move back and forth with a single frequency and phase. The Fermi sea and Pauli blocking, commonly described using independent fermions that occupy lower states to create a ``sea'' in energy space and block occupation is redescribed as a collective energy phenomena of the entire ensemble. Superfluidity, which has always been viewed as a collective phenomena as Cooper pairs are assumed to condense into a macroscopic occupation of a single lowest state, is now reimagined without two-body pairing in real space, but as a macroscopic occupation of a low-energy phonon normal mode resulting in the convergence of the momentum to two equal and opposite values. The expected properties of superfluidity including the rigidity of the wave function, interactions between fermions in different pairs, convergence of the momentum and the gap in the excitation spectrum are discussed.","2023-04-10","2023-04-11 09:26:01","2023-10-09 07:40:15","2023-04-11 09:26:01","","","","","","arXiv:2304.04696 [cond-mat.quant-gas]","The Pauli principle in collective motion","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2650338","arXiv.org","","0 citations (INSPIRE 2023/8/4) 0 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2023/8/4) arXiv:2304.04696 [cond-mat.quant-gas] Citation Key: Watson:2023nfk","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/KXDWB3KL/Watson2023nfk.pdf","","","Condensed Matter - Quantum Gases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The equation-of-motion approach, based on the Langevin equation, is mostly followed throughout the paper. A microscopic derivation of the generalized Langevin equation is outlined, based on the microscopic model of a heat bath as a collection of a large number of independent classical harmonic oscillators. We then consider a fully quantum-mechanical treatment of Brownian motion based on the quantum Langevin equation, where the bath is modelled as a collection of independent quantum harmonic oscillators. In the stationary state, we analyze the quantum counterpart of energy equipartition theorem, which has generated a considerable amount of interest in recent literature. The free energy, entropy and third law of thermodynamics are discussed for the one-dimensional quantum Brownian motion in a harmonic well. Following this, we explore some aspects of dissipative diamagnetism in the context of two-dimensional quantum Brownian motion.

Here we extend these techniques to the arbitrary cohomogeneity stationary case which must be treated in Lorentzian signature. For stationary spacetimes with globally timelike Killing vector the Harmonic Einstein equation is elliptic. In the presence of horizons and ergo-regions it is less obviously so. Motivated by the Rigidity theorem we study a class of stationary black hole spacetimes, considered previously by Harmark, general enough to include the asymptotically flat case in higher dimensions. We argue the Harmonic Einstein equation consistently truncates to this class of spacetimes giving an elliptic problem. The Killing horizons and axes of rotational symmetry are boundaries for this problem and we determine boundary conditions there.

In the vicinity of a quantum critical point, thermodynamics and transport in the system are expected to be controlled by the critical exponents and by the spectrum of irrelevant deformations away from the quantum critical point. Here, using gauge-gravity duality, we present the low temperature dependence of thermodynamic and charge transport coefficients at first order in the hydrodynamic derivative expansion in terms of the critical exponents. Special attention will be paid to the behavior of the charge density of the normal flow in systems with emergent infrared conformal and Lifshitz symmetries, parameterized by a Lifshitz dynamical exponent $z>1$. When $1\leq z<d+2$, we recover ($z=1$) and extend ($z>1$) previous results obtained by relativistic effective field theory techniques. Instead, when $z>d+2$, we show that the normal charge density becomes non-vanishing at zero temperature. An extended appendix generalizes these results to systems that violate hyperscaling as well as systems with generalized photon masses.

Upon breaking translations spontaneously, new gapless collective modes emerge, the Nambu-Goldstone bosons of broken translations. When translations are also weakly broken (eg by disorder or lattice effects), these phonons are pinned with a mass $m$ and damped at a rate $\Omega$, which we explicitly compute. This contribution to $\Omega$ is distinct from that of topological defects. We show that $\Omega\simeq G m^2\Xi$, where $G$ is the shear modulus and $\Xi$ is related to a diffusivity of the purely spontaneous state. This result follows from the smallness of the bulk and shear moduli, as would be the case in a phase with fluctuating translational order. At low temperatures, the collective modes relax quickly into the heat current, so that late time transport is dominated by the thermal diffusivity. In this regime, the resistivity in our model is linear in temperature and the ac conductivity displays a significant rearranging of the degrees of freedom, as spectral weight is shifted from an off-axis, pinning peak to a Drude-like peak. These results could shed light on transport properties in cuprate high $T_c$ superconductors, where quantum critical behavior and translational order occur over large parts of the phase diagram and transport shows qualitatively similar features.","2019-11-20","2022-10-27 08:53:46","2023-09-12 13:18:53","","211602","","21","123","","Phys.

In the sound channel it is set by a pole-pole collision on a non-principal sheet of the Green's function.

We compute the frequency-dependent conductivity of strongly-coupled CFTs using holography of the Einstein-Maxwell theory in 4-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. We compare the results with the corresponding computation of weakly-coupled CFTs, perturbed away from the CFT of free, massless Dirac fermions (which describes graphene at low energies). We find that the results of the two computations have significant qualitative similarities. However, differences do appear in the vicinities of an infinite discrete set of values of $V/k$: the universality class of the infrared CFT changes at these values in the weakly-coupled theory, by the emergence of new zero modes of Dirac fermions which are remnants of local Fermi surfaces.

We verify numerically that, in holographic systems with momentum dissipation, the viscosity to entropy bound might be violated but the shear diffusion constant remains bounded by below. This confirms the idea that $\eta/s$ loses its privileged role in non-relativistic systems and that, in order to find more universal bounds, one should rather look at diffusion constants. We strengthen this idea by showing that, in presence of spontaneously broken translations, the Goldstone diffusion constant satisfies a universal lower bound in terms of the Planckian relaxation time and the butterfly velocity. Additionally, all the diffusive processes in the model satisfy an upper bound, imposed by causality, which is given in terms of the thermalization time -- the imaginary part of the first non-hydrodynamic mode in the spectrum -- and the speed of longitudinal sound. Finally, we discuss the existence of a bound on the speed of sound in holographic conformal solids and we show that the conformal value acts as a lower (and not upper) bound on the speed of longitudinal phonons. Nevertheless, we show that the stiffness $\partial p/\partial \epsilon$ is still bounded by above by its conformal value. This suggests that the bounds conjectured in the past have to be considered on the stiffness of the system, related to its equation of state, and not on the propagation speed of sound.","2020-07-15","2023-08-09 07:40:17","2023-09-12 13:18:49","2023-08-09 07:40:17","007","","1","9","","SciPost Phys.","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1796393","DOI.org (Crossref)","","33 citations (INSPIRE 2023/9/12) 21 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2023/9/12) Citation Key: Baggioli:2020ljz tex.ids= baggioliUniversalBoundsTransport2020 arXiv:2005.06482 [hep-th]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/M3LJ5H3Y/Baggioli2020ljz.pdf","","High Energy Physics - Theory; Quantum Physics; Condensed Matter - Strongly Correlated Electrons; Condensed Matter - Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In metals with sharp Drude peaks, the relevant physics is correctly organized around the slow relaxation of almost-conserved momenta. While in Fermi liquids both currents and momenta relax slowly, due to the weakness of interactions among low energy excitations, in strongly interacting non-Fermi liquids typically only momenta relax slowly. It follows that the conductivities of such non-Fermi liquids are obtained within a fundamentally different kinematics to Fermi liquids. Among these strongly interacting non-Fermi liquids we distinguish cases with only one almost-conserved momentum, which we term hydrodynamic metals, and with many patchwise almost-conserved momenta. For all these cases, we obtain universal expressions for the ratio of conductivities that violate the Wiedemann-Franz law. We further discuss the case in which long-lived `cold' quasiparticles, in general with unconventional scattering rates, coexist with strongly interacting hot spots, lines or bands. For these cases, we characterize circumstances under which non-Fermi liquid transport, in particular a linear in temperature resistivity, is and is not compatible with the Wiedemann-Franz law.

We use numerical studies on both real and imaginary frequency axes, along with asymptotic analyses, to establish the existence of a critical non-Fermi-liquid metallic ground state at large doping, with the spin correlation exponent varying with doping. This critical solution possesses a time-reparametrization symmetry, akin to SYK models, which contributes a linear-in-temperature resistivity over the full range of doping where the solution is present. It is therefore an attractive mean-field description of the overdoped region of cuprates, where experiments have observed a linear-$T$ resistivity in a broad region. The critical metal also displays a strong particle-hole asymmetry, which is relevant to Seebeck coefficient measurements.

As a result, it is part of the reason fields such as ultra-cold atomic physics are so exciting: they can provide quantum emulators of models that could not otherwise be solved, due to the SP. For the same reason, it is also one of the primary motivations behind quantum computation. It is often argued that the SP is not intrinsic to the physics of particular Hamiltonians, since the details of how it onsets, and its eventual occurrence, can be altered by the choice of algorithm or many-particle basis. Despite that, we show that the SP in determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) is quantitatively linked to quantum critical behavior. We demonstrate this via simulations of a number of fundamental models of condensed matter physics, including the spinful and spinless Hubbard Hamiltonians on a honeycomb lattice and the ionic Hubbard Hamiltonian, all of whose critical properties are relatively well understood. We then propose a reinterpretation of the low average sign for the Hubbard model on the square lattice when away from half-filling, an important open problem in condensed matter physics, in terms of the onset of pseudogap behavior and exotic superconductivity. Our study charts a path for exploiting the average sign in QMC simulations to understand quantum critical behavior, rather than solely as an obstacle that prevents quantum simulations of many-body Hamiltonians at low temperature.","2022-01","2023-09-12 13:05:05","2024-02-18 13:41:26","","418–424","","6579","375","","arXiv:2108.08974 [cond-mat.str-el]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1908964","","","16 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 10 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: Mondaini:2021ywk Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science tex.eprint: 2108.08974 arXiv:2108.08974 [cond-mat.str-el]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/TPX3768Z/Mondaini2021ywk.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What seems to be missing is an additional length scale, which may or may not be critical. Second, we prove a generalised version of Luttinger's theorem for a Mott insulator. Namely, regardless of the spatial dimension, the Fermi surface of the non-interacting system is converted into a surface of zeros of the single-particle Green function when the Mott insulator posesses particle-hole symmetry. Only in the presence of particle-hole symmetry does the volume of the surface of zeros equal the particle density.

The mysterious strange metal is characterized by non-Boltzmann transport and violates most fundamental Fermi-liquid scaling laws. A fundamental question is, do strange metals have plasmons? Using momentum-resolved inelastic electron scattering, we recently showed that, rather than a plasmon, optimally doped Bi2.1Sr1.9Ca1.0Cu2.0O8+x (Bi-2212) exhibits a featureless, temperature-independent continuum with a power-law form over most energy and momentum scales [M. Mitrano et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 115, 5392 (2018)]. Here, we show that this continuum is present throughout the fan-shaped, strange metal region of the phase diagram. Outside this region, dramatic changes in spectral weight are observed: In underdoped samples, spectral weight up to 0.5 eV is enhanced at low temperature, biasing the system toward a charge order instability. The situation is reversed in the overdoped case, where spectral weight is strongly suppressed at low temperature, increasing quasiparticle coherence in this regime. Optimal doping corresponds to the boundary between these two opposite behaviors at which the response is temperature independent. Our study suggests that plasmons do not exist as well-defined excitations in Bi-2212 and that a featureless continuum is a defining property of the strange metal, which is connected to a peculiar crossover where the spectral weight change undergoes a sign reversal.","2019-12-26","2022-10-27 08:59:15","2024-02-18 13:41:55","2022-10-27 08:59:14","041062","","4","9","","Phys.

We use the Seebeck coefficient as a probe of the particle-hole asymmetry of the electronic structure across the pseudogap critical doping p⋆=0.23. Outside the pseudogap phase, at p=0.24>p⋆, we observe a positive and essentially isotropic Seebeck coefficient as T→0. That S>0 at p=0.24 is at odds with expectations given the electronic band structure of Nd-LSCO above p⋆ and its known electronlike Fermi surface. We can reconcile this observation by invoking an energy-dependent scattering rate with a particle-hole asymmetry, possibly rooted in the non-Fermi-liquid nature of cuprates just above p⋆. Inside the pseudogap phase, for p<p⋆, Sa is seen to rise at low temperature as previously reported, consistent with the drop in carrier density n from n≃1+p to n≃p across p⋆ as inferred from other transport properties. In stark contrast, Sc at low temperature becomes negative below p⋆, a novel signature of the pseudogap phase. The sudden drop in Sc reveals a change in the electronic structure of Nd-LSCO upon crossing p⋆.

The most discussed of such properties is the linear in temperature resistivity down to asymptotically low temperatures, sometimes called Planckian resistivity, above the region of the highest Tc. Similar anomalies have since also been discovered in the heavy-fermion compounds and in the Fe-based superconducting metals, and most recently in twisted bilayer graphene. Innumerable papers in the past three decades have pointed out that the linear in T resistivity and associated properties are a mystery and the most important unsolved problem in condensed matter physics; superconductivity itself is a corollary to the normal state properties. Even in this prolifically investigated field, quantitative experimental results on crucial normal state and superconducting state properties have only recently become available. It is now possible to compare some of the detailed predictions of a theory for the normal and superconductive state in cuprates and in heavy fermions with the experiments. The theory gives the frequency and temperature dependence of various normal state properties and also their measured magnitudes in terms of the same values of two parameters. It also resolves the paradox of d-wave symmetry of superconductivity in the cuprates given that the scattering rate of fermions in the normal state is nearly momentum independent. The same parameters that govern the normal state anomalies are also deduced from the quantitative analysis of data in the superconducting state in cuprates. The simplicity of the results depends on the discovery of a new class of quantum-critical fluctuation in which orthogonal topological excitations in space and time determine the spectra, such that the correlations of the critical spectra are a product of a function of space and a function of time with the spatial correlation length proportional to the logarithm of the temporal correlation length. The fermions scattering with such fluctuations form a marginal Fermi liquid.","2020-07-07","2022-10-27 08:41:48","2024-02-18 13:41:48","2022-10-27 08:41:47","031001","","3","92","","Rev. Mod.

The triangular structure persists at low temperatures indicating the existence of novel crystalline ground states.","2016-03-21","2021-01-11 12:58:52","2024-02-18 13:42:23","2021-01-11 12:58:52","148","","3","03","","JHEP","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1411116","arXiv.org","","32 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 26 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: Donos:2015eew tex.ids= donos2016a arXiv: 1512.06861 [hep-th] tex.eprint: 1512.06861","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/UYGYUS32/Donos2015eew.pdf; /home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/8Q74NP46/Donos2015eew.pdf","","AdS-CFT Correspondence; Black Holes in String Theory; Holography and condensed matter physics (AdS/CMT)","High Energy Physics - Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Detected originally through high magnetic field, transport experiments, signatures of this phase have now been uncovered with a variety of probes. Our high resolution optical data of the low T$_{c}$ cuprate superconductor, Bi$_{2-x}$Pb$_{x}$Sr$_{2-y}$La$_{y}$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ allows us to probe this phase over a large energy and temperature window. We demonstrate that the optical signatures of the strange metal phase persist throughout the phase diagram. The strange metal signatures in the optical conductivity are two-fold, (i): a low energy Drude response with Drude width on the order of temperature and (ii): a high energy conformal tail with doping dependent power-law exponent. While the Drude weight evolves monotonously throughout the entire doping range studied, the spectral weight contained in the high energy conformal tail appears to be doping and temperature independent. Our analysis further shows that the temperature dependence of the optical conductivity is completely determined by the Drude parameters. Our results indicate that there is no critical doping level inside the superconducting dome where the carrier density starts to change drastically and that the previously observed 'return to normalcy' is a consequence of the increasing importance of the Drude component relative to the conformal tail with doping. Importantly, both the doping and temperature dependence of the resistivity are largely determined by the Drude width.","2022-08-01","2022-10-27 08:34:28","2024-02-18 13:41:14","2022-10-27 08:34:27","054515","","5","106","","Phys.

We show that near a class of strongly interacting quantum critical points that arise in the infra-red limit of translationally invariant holographic theories, there is a collective excitation (a quasinormal mode of the dual black hole spacetime) whose lifetime $\tau_{eq}$ is parametrically longer than $\tau_P$: $\tau_{eq}\gg T^{-1}$. The lifetime is enhanced due to its dependence on a dangerously irrelevant coupling that breaks the particle-hole symmetry and the invariance under Lorentz boosts of the quantum critical point. The thermal diffusivity (in units of the butterfly velocity) is anomalously large near the quantum critical point and is governed by $\tau_{eq}$ rather than $\tau_P$. We conjecture that there exists a long-lived, propagating collective mode with velocity $v_s$, and in this case the relation $D=v_s^2\tau_{eq}$ holds exactly in the limit $T\tau_{eq}\gg1$.

Here we provide direct imaging of the Poiseuille flow of an electronic fluid, as well as a visualization of its evolution from ballistic flow. Using a scanning carbon nanotube single-electron transistor12, we image the Hall voltage of electronic flow through channels of high-mobility graphene. We find that the profile of the Hall field across the channel is a key physical quantity for distinguishing ballistic from hydrodynamic flow. We image the transition from flat, ballistic field profiles at low temperatures into parabolic field profiles at elevated temperatures, which is the hallmark of Poiseuille flow. The curvature of the imaged profiles is qualitatively reproduced by Boltzmann calculations, which allow us to create a ‘phase diagram’ that characterizes the electron flow regimes.

Also considering associated horizonless geometries called boson stars, we obtain phase diagrams with fairly rich structure in the grand canonical ensemble depending on the boundary condition parameter or the deformation parameter, where phase transition occurs between thermal AdS, RNAdS, charged boson stars, and hairy black holes.","2023-06-19","2023-06-23 14:13:53","2024-02-18 13:40:56","2023-06-23 14:13:53","106","","","06","","JHEP","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2649318","arXiv.org","","6 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 4 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) arXiv:2304.02267 [hep-th] Citation Key: Harada:2023cfl","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/PATM38UB/Harada2023cfl.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology; High Energy Physics - Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are the natural product of the complete gravitational collapse of matter and today we have a body of observational evidence supporting the existence of black holes in the Universe. However, general relativity predicts that at the center of black holes there are spacetime singularities, where predictability is lost and standard physics breaks down. It is widely believed that spacetime singularities are a symptom of the limitations of general relativity and must be solved within a theory of quantum gravity. Since we do not have yet any mature and reliable candidate for a quantum gravity theory, researchers have studied toy-models of singularity-free black holes and of singularity-free gravitational collapses in order to explore possible implications of the yet unknown theory of quantum gravity. This book reviews all main models of regular black holes and non-singular gravitational collapses proposed in the literature, and discuss the theoretical and observational implications of these scenarios.","2023","2023-07-26 06:52:48","2023-09-29 08:20:12","2023-07-26 06:52:27","","","","","","","Regular Black Holes","","","","","Springer Singapore","","","","","INSPIRE","2675514","arXiv.org","","3 citations (INSPIRE 2023/9/29) 2 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2023/9/29) arXiv:2307.13249 [gr-qc] Citation Key: Bambi:2023try","","","","","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, by studying the pole-skipping points of the response function of the operator dual to the tensor part of the metric perturbation in the bulk, we discover a set of order parameters that distinguish the two states of the system near the quantum critical point. Each of these order parameters is the sum of the absolute values of the real parts of momentum at all pole-skipping points associated with a particular frequency.

Here, we extend this analysis to the domain of large but finite 't Hooft coupling. To leading order in the perturbative expansion, we find that the radii grow with increasing inverse coupling, contrary to naive expectations. However, when the equations of motion are solved using a qualitative non-perturbative resummation, the dependence on the coupling becomes piecewise continuous and the initial growth is followed by a decrease. The piecewise nature of the dependence is related to the dynamics of branch point singularities of the energy-momentum tensor finite-temperature two-point functions in the complex plane of spatial momentum squared. We repeat the study using the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity as a model where the equations can be solved fully non-perturbatively, and find the expected decrease of the radii of convergence with the effective inverse coupling which is also piecewise continuous.

Such theories are parameterized by two real exponents $(\gamma,\delta)$ that control the IR dynamics. By studying the thermodynamics, spectra and conductivities of several classes of charged dilatonic black hole solutions that include the charge density back reaction fully, the landscape of such theories in view of condensed matter applications is characterized. Several regions of the $(\gamma,\delta)$ plane can be excluded as the extremal solutions have unacceptable singularities. The classical solutions have generically zero entropy at zero temperature, except when $\gamma=\delta$ where the entropy at extremality is finite. The general scaling of DC resistivity with temperature at low temperature, and AC conductivity at low frequency and temperature across the whole $(\gamma,\delta)$ plane, is found. There is a codimension-one region where the DC resistivity is linear in the temperature. For massive carriers, it is shown that when the scalar operator is not the dilaton, the DC resistivity scales as the heat capacity (and entropy) for planar (3d) systems. Regions are identified where the theory at finite density is a Mott-like insulator at T=0. We also find that at low enough temperatures the entropy due to the charge carriers is generically larger than at zero charge density.","2010","2023-09-12 13:05:02","2024-02-18 13:42:45","","151","","11","11","","JHEP","","","","","","","","english","","","INSPIRE","856334","","","528 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 460 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: Charmousis:2010zz arXiv:1005.4690 [hep-th] tex.eprint: 1005.4690 number: CCTP-2010-5, LPT-10-34","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/AMHJ5XX4/Charmousis2010zz.pdf","","","AdS-CFT Correspondence; Black Holes; Black Holes in String Theory; Condensed Matter - Strongly Correlated Electrons; General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology; High Energy Physics - Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigate to what extent this relation is universal in the Q-lattice models with infrared (IR) scaling geometry, focusing on the effect of spatial anisotropy. Indeed it was shown that $\mathcal{E}_i := D_{T,i}/(v_{B,i}^2 \tau_L)$ ($i=x,y$) is determined only by some scaling exponents of the IR metric in the low temperature limit regardless of the matter fields and ultraviolet data. Inspired by this observation, in this work, we find the concrete expressions for $\mathcal{E}_i$ in terms of the critical dynamical exponents $z_i$ in each direction. By analyzing the IR scaling geometry we identify the allowed scaling parameter regimes, which enable us to compute the allowed range of $\mathcal{E}_i$.

This black hole has two properties which one might reasonably demand of the dual of a Fermi liquid: Its entropy is proportional to temperature at low temperature, and its extremal limit supports normal modes of massless, charged bulk fermions. The black hole we study has a simple analytic form because it can be embedded in type IIB string theory as the near-horizon limit of D3-branes with equal spins in two of the three independent transverse planes. Two further properties can be deduced from this embedding: There is a thermodynamic instability, reminiscent of ferromagnetism, at low temperatures/ and there is an AdS_3 factor in the extremal near-horizon geometry which accounts for the linear dependence of entropy on temperature. Altogether, it is plausible that the dilatonic black hole we study, or a relative of it with similar behavior in the infrared, is the dual of a Fermi liquid/ however, the particular embedding in string theory that we consider is unlikely to have such a dual description, unless through some unexpected boson-fermion equivalence at large N.","2010","2023-09-12 13:05:04","2024-02-18 13:42:44","","046001","","4","81","","Phys.

First, it is not consistent with the general principles of the quantum theory, which require that all uncertainty relations be expressible in terms of the mathematical formalism, i.e., by means of operators, wave functions, etc. Secondly, the examples of measurement processes that were used to derive the above uncertainty relation are not general enough.

In Fermi liquids with a large Fermi surface and weak electron-impurity scattering, we provide universal and simple formulas for the behavior of the thermoelectric conductivities across the ballistic-to-hydrodynamic crossover. In this regime, the electrical conductivity is relatively unchanged by hydrodynamic effects. In contrast, the thermal conductivity can be parametrically smaller than predicted by the Wiedemann-Franz law. A less severe violation of the Mott law arises. We quantitatively compare the violations of the Wiedemann-Franz law arising from (i) momentum-conserving electron-electron scattering in the collision integral, (ii) hydrodynamic modifications of the electron-impurity scattering rate, and (iii) thermal broadening of the Fermi surface, and show that (i) is the largest. We present simple formulas for electrical and thermal magnetoconductivity across the ballistic-to-hydrodynamic limit, along with a more complicated formula for the thermoelectric magnetoconductivity. In a finite magnetic field, the Lorenz number may be smaller or larger than predicted by the Wiedemann-Franz law, and the crossover between these behaviors is a clear prediction for experiments. The arbitrarily strong violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law found in our work arises entirely from electron-electron interaction effects within the Fermi liquid paradigm, and does not imply any non-Fermi liquid behavior.

This paper investigates many of the basic geometric objects associated to this space, including the Levi-Civita connection, the geodesic equation, the curvature, and the Jacobi equation. We show that the optimal Hamiltonian evolution for synthesis of a desired unitary necessarily obeys a simple universal geodesic equation. As a consequence, once the initial value of the Hamiltonian is set, subsequent changes to the Hamiltonian are completely determined by the geodesic equation. We develop many analytic solutions to the geodesic equation, and a set of invariants that completely determine the geodesics. We investigate the problem of finding minimal geodesics through a desired unitary, U, and develop a procedure which allows us to deform the (known) geodesics of a simple and well understood metric to the geodesics of the metric of interest in quantum computation. This deformation procedure is illustrated using some three-qubit numerical examples. We study the computational complexity of evaluating distances on Riemmanian manifolds, and show that no efficient classical algorithm for this problem exists, subject to the assumption that good pseudorandom generators exist. Finally, we develop a canonical extension procedure for unitary operations which allows ancilla qubits to be incorporated into the geometric approach to quantum computing.","2008","2023-09-12 13:24:13","2024-02-18 13:42:49","","0861-0899","","10","8","","Quant.

We conclude using the CV conjecture that the rate of change of complexity is a monotonically increasing function of time, which saturates from below to a positive constant in the late time limit. Using the CA conjecture for uncharged black holes, the holographic complexity remains constant for an initial period, then briefly decreases but quickly begins to increase. As observed previously, at late times, the rate of growth of the complexity approaches a constant, which may be associated with Lloyd's bound on the rate of computation. However, we find that this late time limit is approached from above, thus violating the bound. Adding a charge to the eternal black holes washes out the early time behaviour, i.e., complexity immediately begins increasing with sufficient charge, but the late time behaviour is essentially the same as in the neutral case. We also evaluate the complexity of formation for charged black holes and find that it is divergent for extremal black holes, implying that the states at finite chemical potential and zero temperature are infinitely more complex than their finite temperature counterparts.","2017-11-28","2023-09-12 13:24:14","2024-02-18 13:42:13","","188","","","11","","JHEP","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1627859","","","278 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 251 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: Carmi:2017jqz arXiv:1709.10184 [hep-th]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/UBH84DKJ/Carmi2017jqz.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we find the solutions for extremal and near extremal branes through a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. The near horizon geometries in the simplest cases, where $f(\phi) = e^{\alpha\phi}$, are Lifshitz-like, with a dynamical exponent $z$ determined by $\alpha$. The black hole thermodynamics varies in an interesting way with $\alpha$, but in all cases the entropy is vanishing and the specific heat is positive for the near extremal solutions. We then compute conductivity in these backgrounds. We find that somewhat surprisingly, the AC conductivity vanishes like $\omega^2$ at T=0 independent of $\alpha$. We also explore the charged black brane physics of several other classes of gauge-coupling functions $f(\phi)$. In addition to possible applications in AdS/CMT, the extremal black branes are of interest from the point of view of the attractor mechanism. The near horizon geometries for these branes are universal, independent of the asymptotic values of the moduli, and describe generic classes of endpoints for attractor flows which are different from $AdS_2\times R^2$.","2010","2023-09-12 13:24:16","2024-02-18 13:42:45","","078","","","08","","JHEP","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","837271","","","305 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 290 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: Goldstein:2009cv arXiv:0911.3586 [hep-th] number: NSF-KITP-09-174, TIFR-TH-09-41, WITS-CTP-046","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/YDJCMFWU/Goldstein2009cv.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inspired by simple constructions achieved for the case of disks and the half-plane, we reformulate bit threads in terms of a magnetic-like field generated by a current flowing through the boundary of the entangling region. The construction is possible for these highly symmetric settings, leading us to a modified Biot-Savart law in curved space that fully characterizes the entanglement structure of the state. For general entangling regions, the prescription breaks down as the corresponding modular Hamiltonians become inherently nonlocal. We develop a formalism for general shape deformations and derive a flow equation that accounts for these effects as a systematic expansion. We solve this equation for a complete set of small deformations and show that the structure of the expansion explicitly codifies the expected nonlocalities.

As a consequence, a fruitful interplay has developed between analyses of strongly-coupled non-abelian plasmas via the gauge/string duality (also referred to as the AdS/CFT correspondence) and the phenomenology of heavy ion collisions. We review some of the main insights gained from this interplay to date. To establish a common language, we start with an introduction to heavy ion phenomenology and finite-temperature QCD, and a corresponding introduction to important concepts and techniques in the gauge/string duality. These introductory sections are written for nonspecialists, with the goal of bringing readers ranging from beginning graduate students to experienced practitioners of either QCD or gauge/string duality to the point that they understand enough about both fields that they can then appreciate their interplay in all appropriate contexts. We then review the current state-of-the art in the application of the duality to the description of the dynamics of strongly coupled plasmas, with emphases that include: its thermodynamic, hydrodynamic and transport properties/ the way it both modifies the dynamics of, and is perturbed by, high-energy or heavy quarks passing through it/ and the physics of quarkonium mesons within it. We seek throughout to stress the lessons that can be extracted from these computations for heavy ion physics as well as to discuss future directions and open problems for the field.","2014","2023-09-19 07:46:17","2024-02-18 13:42:32","2023-03-16","","","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","Cambridge","","","","INSPIRE","883144","","","809 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 749 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: Casalderrey-Solana:2011dxg arXiv:1101.0618 [hep-th] DOI: 10.1017/CBO9781139136747","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/IHHG43IS/Casalderrey-Solana2011dxg.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All the low-energy degrees of freedom induced by quantum criticality are usually assumed to be spatially extended, corresponding to long-wavelength fluctuations of the order parameter. But this picture has been contradicted by the results of recent experiments on a prototype system: heavy fermion metals at a zero-temperature magnetic transition. In particular, neutron scattering from CeCu6-x Aux has revealed anomalous dynamics at atomic length scales, leading to much debate as to the fate of the local moments in the quantum-critical regime. Here we report our theoretical finding of a locally critical quantum phase transition in a model of heavy fermions. The dynamics at the critical point are in agreement with experiment.

We numerically compute the electromagnetic and gravitational quasinormal frequencies (in the shear channel) of the extremal Reissner-Nordstrom AdS(4) black hole corresponding to the spectrum of poles in the retarded correlators.

These developments suggest that the physics of such matter may be governed by surprisingly simple principles. My real objective is to present an experimental strategy to test critically whether these principles are actually at work, revolving around the famous linear resistivity characterizing the strange metal phase. The theory suggests a very simple explanation of this ""unreasonably simple"" behavior that is actually directly linked to remarkable results from the study of the quark gluon plasma formed at the heavy ion colliders: the ""fast hydrodynamization"" and the ""minimal viscosity"". This leads to high quality predictions for experiment: the momentum relaxation rate governing the resistivity relates directly to the electronic entropy, while at low temperatures the electron fluid should become unviscous to a degree that turbulent flows can develop even on the nanometre scale.","2019-05-20","2022-10-27 08:38:24","2024-02-18 13:42:01","2023-08-09 07:39:23","061","","5","6","","SciPost Phys.","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1684344","DOI.org (Crossref)","","74 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 69 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: Zaanen:2018edk tex.ids= zaanenPlanckianDissipationMinimal2019 arXiv: 1807.10951 [cond-mat.str-el] tex.eprint: 1807.10951","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/QF8QRGDP/Zaanen2018edk.pdf","","Condensed Matter - Strongly Correlated Electrons; High Energy Physics - Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The basic electronic structure of cuprates is reviewed, emphasizing the physics of strong correlation and establishing the model of a doped Mott insulator as a starting point. A variety of experiments are discussed, focusing on the region of the phase diagram close to the Mott insulator (the underdoped region) where the behavior is most anomalous. The normal state in this region exhibits pseudogap phenomenon. In contrast, the quasiparticles in the superconducting state are well defined and behave according to theory. This review introduces Anderson’s idea of the resonating valence bond and argues that it gives a qualitative account of the data. The importance of phase fluctuations is discussed, leading to a theory of the transition temperature, which is driven by phase fluctuations and the thermal excitation of quasiparticles. However, an argument is made that phase fluctuations can only explain pseudogap phenomenology over a limited temperature range, and some additional physics is needed to explain the onset of singlet formation at very high temperatures. A description of the numerical method of the projected wave function is presented, which turns out to be a very useful technique for implementing the strong correlation constraint and leads to a number of predictions which are in agreement with experiments. The remainder of the paper deals with an analytic treatment of the t−J model, with the goal of putting the resonating valence bond idea on a more formal footing. The slave boson is introduced to enforce the constraint againt double occupation and it is shown that the implementation of this local constraint leads naturally to gauge theories. This review follows the historical order by first examining the U(1) formulation of the gauge theory. Some inadequacies of this formulation for underdoping are discussed, leading to the SU(2) formulation. Here follows a rather thorough discussion of the role of gauge theory in describing the spin-liquid phase of the undoped Mott insulator. The difference between the high-energy gauge group in the formulation of the problem versus the low-energy gauge group, which is an emergent phenomenon, is emphasized. Several possible routes to deconfinement based on different emergent gauge groups are discussed, which leads to the physics of fractionalization and spin-charge separation. Next the extension of the SU(2) formulation to nonzero doping is described with a focus on a part of the mean-field phase diagram called the staggered flux liquid phase. It will be shown that inclusion of the gauge fluctuation provides a reasonable description of the pseudogap phase. It is emphasized that d-wave superconductivity can be considered as evolving from a stable U(1) spin liquid. These ideas are applied to the high-Tc cuprates, and their implications for the vortex structure and the phase diagram are discussed. A possible test of the topological structure of the pseudogap phase is described.","2006-01-06","2022-10-27 08:39:21","2024-02-18 13:42:53","2022-10-27 08:39:19","17-85","","1","78","","Rev. Mod.

Here we show that T-linear resistivity as T → 0 is a generic property of cuprates, associated with a universal scattering rate. We measured the low-temperature resistivity of the bilayer cuprate Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+δ and found that it exhibits a T-linear dependence with the same slope as in the single-layer cuprates Bi2Sr2CuO6+δ (ref. 6), La1.6-xNd0.4SrxCuO4 (ref. 7) and La2-xSrxCuO4 (ref. 8), despite their very different Fermi surfaces and structural, superconducting and magnetic properties. We then show that the T-linear coefficient (per CuO2 plane), A1□, is given by the universal relation A1□TF = h/2e2, where e is the electron charge, h is the Planck constant and TF is the Fermi temperature.

The properties of the quantum nonlinear σ model are analyzed approximately using the one-loop renormalization-group method. When the model has long-range order at T=0, the long-wavelength behavior at finite temperatures can be described by a purely classical model, with parameters renormalized by the quantum fluctuations. The low-temperature behavior of the correlation length and the static and dynamic staggered-spin-correlation functions for the quantum antiferromagnet can be predicted, in principle, with no adjustable parameters, from the results of simulations of the classical model on a lattice, combined with a two-loop renormalization-group analysis of the classical nonlinear σ model, a calculation of the zero-temperature spin-wave stiffness constant and uniform susceptibility of the quantum antiferromagnet, and a one-loop analysis of the conversion from a lattice cutoff to the wave-vector cutoff introduced by quantum mechanics when the spin-wave frequency exceeds Tℏ. Applying this approach to the spin-½ Heisenberg model on a square lattice, with nearest-neighbor interactions only, we obtain a result for the correlation length which is in good agreement with the data of Endoh et al. on La2CuO4, if the spin-wave velocity is assumed to be 0.67 eV Åℏ. We also argue that the data on La2CuO4 cannot be easily explained by any model in which an isolated CuO2 layer would not have long-range antiferromagnetic order at T=0. Our theory also predicts a quasielastic peak of a few meV width at 300 K when kξ≪1 (where k is wave-vector transfer and ξ is the correlation length). The extent to which this dynamical prediction agrees with experiments remains to be seen. In an appendix, we discuss the effect of introducing a frustrating second-nearest-neighbor coupling for the antiferromagnet on the square lattice.","1989-02-01","2022-10-27 08:37:48","2024-02-18 13:43:09","2022-10-27 08:37:48","2344-2371","","4","39","","Phys.

The most dramatic spatial anisotropy at a critical point occurs at a Lifshitz transition, found in systems with merging Dirac or Weyl point or near the superconductor-insulator quantum phase transition. Previous work found that in these systems a famous conjecture on the existence of a lower bound for the ratio of a shear viscosity to entropy is violated, and proposed a generalization of this bound for anisotropic systems near charge neutrality involving the electric conductivities. The present study uses scaling arguments and the gauge-gravity duality to confirm the previous analysis of universal bounds in anisotropic Dirac systems. We investigate the strongly-coupled phase of quantum Lifshitz systems in a gravitational Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model with a linear massless scalar which breaks translations in the boundary dual field theory and sources the anisotropy. The holographic computation demonstrates that some elements of the viscosity tensor can be related to the ratio of the electric conductivities through a simple geometric ratio of elements of the bulk metric evaluated at the horizon, and thus obey a generalized bound, while others violate it. From the IR critical geometry, we express the charge diffusion constants in terms of the square butterfly velocities.

Our exact computation demonstrates a modification to the Lifshitz Ward identity for the EMD theory. For transport, we target our analysis at finite chemical potential and include axion fields to generate momentum dissipation. While our exact results corroborate anticipated bounds, we are able to demonstrate that the diffusivities are governed by the engineering dimension of the diffusion coefficient, $[D]=2-z$. Consequently, a $\beta$-function defined as the derivative of the trace of the diffusion matrix with respect to the effective lattice spacing changes sign precisely at $z=2$. At $z=2$, the diffusion equation exhibits perfect scale invariance and the corresponding diffusion constant is the pure number $1/d_s$ for both the charge and energy sectors, where $d_s$ is the number of spatial dimensions. Further, we find that as $z\to\infty$, the charge diffusion constant vanishes, indicating charge localization.

Similar to the materials which exhibit thermal diffusivity close to this bound, our scenario involves complex unit cell with incoherent intra-cell dynamics. We derive a general formalism to compute thermal conductivity in such cases with anharmonic intra-cell dynamics coupled to nearly harmonic inter-cell coupling.

It exhibits a maximally chaotic behavior characterized by out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and is expected to be a holographic dual to black holes. Recently, a striking similarity between the SYK model and the Hund-coupling induced spin-freezing crossover in multi-orbital Hubbard models has been pointed out. To further explore this connection, we study OTOCs for fermionic Hubbard models, which are prototypical models for strongly correlated electrons in solids. We introduce an imaginary-time four-point correlation function with an appropriate time ordering, which by means of the spectral representation and the out-of-time-order fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be analytically continued to real-time OTOCs. Based on this approach, we numerically evaluate real-time OTOCs for Hubbard models in the thermodynamic limit, using the dynamical mean-field theory in combination with a numerically exact continuous-time Monte Carlo impurity solver. The results for the single-orbital model show that a certain spin-related OTOC captures local moment formation in the vicinity of the metal-insulator transition, while the self-energy does not show SYK-like non-Fermi liquid behavior. On the other hand, for the two- and three-orbital models with nonzero Hund coupling we find that the OTOC exhibits a rapid damping at short times and an approximate power-law decay at longer times in the spin-freezing crossover regime characterized by fluctuating local moments and a non-Fermi liquid self-energy $\Sigma(\omega) \sim \sqrt{\omega}$. These results are in a good agreement with the behavior of the SYK model, providing firm evidence for the close relation between the spin-freezing crossover physics of multi-orbital Hubbard models and the SYK strange metal.","2019-03-22","2023-09-12 13:05:02","2023-09-12 13:05:44","","115132","","11","99","","Phys.

Furthermore, the dominant coherent modes in the longitudinal channel, which control the neutral density-density correlator, are diffusive. We show these modes are strongly suppressed when the boundary Coulomb interaction is turned on. This renders the low frequency charge density response spectrum completely incoherent and featureless. At intermediate frequencies, we observe a broad feature -- the fake plasmon -- in the dressed correlator, which could be confused with an overdamped plasmon. However, its gap is set by the scale of translation symmetry breaking instead of the plasma frequency. This broad feature originates from the non-hydrodynamic sector of the holographic spectrum, and therefore, its behaviour, typical of strongly correlated quantum critical systems with holographic duals, deviates from the standard Fermi-liquid paradigm.","2019-12-30","2023-09-12 13:05:02","2023-09-12 13:05:44","","159","","","12","","JHEP","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1756199","","","6 citations (INSPIRE 2023/9/12) 6 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2023/9/12) Citation Key: Andrade:2019bky arXiv:1909.12242 [hep-th]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/ERXNRM6T/Andrade2019bky.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We further show that by introducing a $(d + 1)$-dimensional Coulomb interaction in a boundary theory in $d$ spacetime dimensions, we recover plasmon modes whose dispersion is proportional to $\sqrt{|\mathbf{k}|}$, as observed for example in graphene layers. Moreover, motivated by recent experimental results in layered cuprate high-temperature superconductors, we present a toy model for a layered system consisting of an infinite stack of (spatially) two-dimensional layers, that are coupled only by the long-range Coulomb interaction. This leads to low-energy `acoustic plasmons'.

The characteristic initial (boundary) value problem has numerous applications in general relativity involving numerical studies and is often formulated using Bondi-like coordinates. Well-posedness of the resulting systems of partial differential equations, however, remains an open question. The answer to this question affects the accuracy, and potentially the reliability of conclusions drawn from numerical studies based on such formulations. In the first part of this thesis, we expand our understanding of the hyperbolicity and well-posedness of Bondi-like free evolution systems. We show that several prototype Bondi-like formulations are only weakly hyperbolic and examine the root cause of this result. Consequently, the characteristic initial (boundary) value problem of general relativity in these gauges is rendered ill-posed in the simplest norms one would like to employ. We discuss the implications of this result in accurate gravitational waveform modeling methods and work towards the construction of alternative norms that might be more appropriate. We also present numerical tests that demonstrate weak hyperbolicity in practice and highlight important features to perform them effectively. In the second part, we turn our attention to applications of these formulations to the qualitative behavior of strongly coupled systems via holography.","2023-08-30","2023-08-31 08:35:51","2023-08-31 08:35:52","2023-08-31 08:35:51","","","","","","arXiv:2308.16001 [gr-qc]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2692021","arXiv.org","","0 citations (INSPIRE 2023/8/31) 0 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2023/8/31) arXiv:2308.16001 [gr-qc] Citation Key: Giannakopoulos:2023nrb","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/XHJZKR5A/Giannakopoulos2023nrb.pdf","","","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology; High Energy Physics - Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This class includes (i) so-called marginal exemplars and (ii) systems that harbor interaction-driven flat bands, in both of which manifestations of non-Fermi-liquid behavior are well documented. Specifically, the advent of such flat bands is attributed to a spontaneous topological rearrangement of the Landau state that supplements the conventional Landau quasiparticle picture with a different set of quasiparticles, the so-called fermion condensate, whose single-particle spectrum is dispersionless. The celebrated Landau-Luttinger theorem is extended to marginal Fermi liquids, in which the density of the augmented quasiparticle system is shown to coincide with the particle density. On the other hand, the total density of a system hosting an interaction-driven flat band turns out to be the sum of the densities of the two quasiparticle subsystems: the Landau-like component and the fermion condensate. We demonstrate that within the framework of the scenario proposed, salient features of $D$-wave superconductivity of overdoped cuprates, including the ratio $T_c^{\rm max}/T_F$ of the maximum critical temperature to the Fermi temperature on the Uemura plot, are properly described.","2023-08-25","2023-08-29 11:49:52","2023-08-29 11:49:53","2023-08-29 11:49:52","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2305.19385 [cond-mat]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/V6LP3RLI/khodel2023.pdf","","","⛔ No INSPIRE recid found; Condensed Matter - Strongly Correlated Electrons","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2305.19385","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One is the infrared (IR) geometry to be renormalization group (RG) unstable, and the other is the strength of lattice deformation leading to some kind of bifurcating solution. We also find a novel QPT in the metal phases. The study on the behavior of the butterfly velocity crossing QPT indicates that the butterfly velocity or its first derivative exhibiting local extreme depends on the QPT mechanism. Further, the scaling behaviors of the butterfly velocity in the zero-temperature limit confirm that different phases are controlled by different IR geometries.

Furthermore, we also establish the phenomenon of pole-skipping for the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, and we find that the value of the momentum for which this phenomenon occurs need not be within the radius of convergence of hydrodynamics.","2020-10-19","2021-10-15 09:04:43","2024-02-18 13:41:44","2021-10-15 09:04:43","121","","10","10","","JHEP","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1809177","arXiv.org","","45 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 42 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) arXiv:2007.14418 [hep-th] Citation Key: Jansen:2020hfd","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/LUU789ZD/Jansen2020hfd.pdf","","","High Energy Physics - Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Electromagnetics is an inherently non-Hermitian research area because all materials are lossy, loss and gain distributions can be controlled with various mechanisms, and the underlying systems are open to radiation. Therefore, the recent developments in non-Hermitian physics offer exciting opportunities for a broad range of basic research and engineering applications relevant to the antennas and propagation community. In this work, we offer a tutorial geared at introducing the unusual electromagnetic phenomena emerging in non-Hermitian systems, with particular emphasis on a sub-class of these systems that obey parity-time (PT) symmetry. We discuss the basic concepts behind this topic and explore their implications for various phenomena. We first discuss the basic features of P, T and PT operators applied to electromagnetic and quantum mechanical phenomena. We then discuss the exotic response of PT-symmetric electromagnetic structures and their opportunities, with particular attention to singularities, known as exceptional points, emerging in these systems, and their unusual scattering response.","2021-03-15","2023-03-31 13:39:42","2023-03-31 13:39:43","2023-03-31 13:39:42","","","","","","","Parity-Time Symmetry and Exceptional points","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2103.08135 [physics]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/ECPB8D3F/krasnok2021.pdf","","","⛔ No INSPIRE recid found; Physics - Optics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2103.08135","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we report an in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of three-dimensional Fermi surfaces in La2-xSrxCuO4 thin films(x = 0.06 - 0.35).

The B1g phonon anomaly in high-Tc cuprate superconductors has long been studied; however, the correlation between the B1g phonon anomaly and superconductivity has yet to be clarified. In the present study, we successfully reproduced the B1g phonon anomaly in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO) using an ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation and temperature-dependent effective potential (TDEP) method. The Ag phonon by Ba atoms shows a more severe anomaly than the B1g phonon at low temperatures. Our analysis of the phonon anomaly and the temperature-dependent phonon dispersion indicated that decoupling between thermal phenomena and electron transport at low temperatures leads to layer-by-layer thermal decoupling in YBCO. Electronically and thermally isolated Ba atoms in YBCO are responsible for the thermal decoupling. The analytic study of the thermal dcoupling revealed that Planckian dissipation expressing linear-T resistivity is another expression of the Fermi liquid of the CuO$_2$ plane. The Uemura plot of the relationship between Tc and the Fermi temperature, as well as the superconducting dome in YBCO, is explained rigorously and quantitatively. Our findings not only present a new paradigm for understanding high-Tc superconductivity but also imply that the spontaneous formation of low-temperature layers in materials can lead to revolutionary changes in the thermal issues of industrial fields.","2023-03-21","2023-03-23 10:04:17","2023-03-23 10:04:18","2023-03-23 10:04:17","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2303.11600 [cond-mat]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/YTUQ58NU/lee2023.pdf","","","⛔ No INSPIRE recid found; Condensed Matter - Superconductivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2303.11600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We begin by discussing the ""phase diagram"" of graphene, and the inevitable presence of impurities and phonons in experimental systems. We derive hydrodynamics, both from a phenomenological perspective and using kinetic theory. We then describe how hydrodynamic electron flow is visible in electronic transport measurements. Although we focus on graphene in this review, the broader framework naturally generalizes to other materials.

Using this method, we compute the numerical spectrum of quasinormal modes associated with fluctuations of spin 0, 1 and 2, non-perturbatively in $\mu/T$. We also analytically compute the spectrum of hydrodynamic excitations in the small chemical potential limit. Then, by studying the spectral curve at complex momenta in every spin channel, we numerically find points at which hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic poles collide. We discuss the relation between such collision points and the convergence radius of the hydrodynamic derivative expansion. Specifically in the spin 0 channel, we find that within the range $1.1\lesssim \mu/T\lesssim 2$, the radius of convergence of the hydrodynamic sound mode is set by the absolute value of the complex momentum corresponding to the point at which the sound pole collides with the hydrodynamic diffusion pole. It shows that in holographic systems at finite chemical potential, the convergence of the hydrodynamic derivative expansion in the mentioned range is fully controlled by hydrodynamic information. As the last result, we explicitly show that the relevant information about quantum chaos in our system can be extracted from the pole-skipping points of energy density response function. We find a threshold value for $\mu/T$, lower than which the pole-skipping points can be computed perturbatively in a derivative expansion.","2020-10-13","2021-12-01 09:56:40","2024-02-18 13:41:44","2021-12-01 09:56:40","076","","10","10","","JHEP","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1807892","arXiv.org","","57 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 53 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: Abbasi:2020ykq tex.ids= Abbasi:2020ykqa arXiv: 2007.10024 [hep-th]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/KREF2RIG/Abbasi2020ykq.pdf","","High Energy Physics - Theory; Nuclear Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The thermodynamics of AdS black holes in Einstein-scalar gravity is studied by using the standard holographic renormalization procedure and the variation of the Hamiltonian via the Wald formalism. It is found that the first law requires a modification by including an additional term that has a particular form $\sim\left<O\right>\delta \phi_s$, with $\phi_s$ and $\left<O\right>$ a new pair of thermodynamic conjugate variables. $\phi_s$ is the leading source term of the asymptotic fall-off of the scalar field near the AdS boundary, and $\left<O\right>$ is precisely the response of the dual scalar operator from the holographic point of view.

In the vicinity of a quantum critical point, it is expected that some aspects of the dynamics are universal and dictated by properties of the critical point. We use gauge-gravity duality to investigate the breakdown of diffusive hydrodynamics in two low temperature states dual to black holes with AdS$_2$ horizons, which exhibit quantum critical dynamics with an emergent scaling symmetry in time. We find that the breakdown is characterized by a collision between the diffusive pole of the retarded Green's function with a pole associated to the AdS$_2$ region of the geometry, such that the local equilibration time is set by infra-red properties of the theory. The absolute values of the frequency and wavevector at the collision ($\omega_{eq}$ and $k_{eq}$) provide a natural characterization of all the low temperature diffusivities $D$ of the states via $D=\omega_{eq}/k_{eq}^2$ where $\omega_{eq}=2\pi\Delta T$ is set by the temperature $T$ and the scaling dimension $\Delta$ of an operator of the infra-red quantum critical theory. We confirm that these relations are also satisfied in an SYK chain model in the limit of strong interactions.

The width of these channels, and hence the electrical resistance, is determined by a competition between viscous and thermoelectric forces. For the case of periodic (moiré) potentials, we find that hydrodynamic flow provides a new route to linear-in-$T$ resistivity. We calculate the associated prefactors for potentials with $C_3$ and $C_4$ symmetry. On the other hand, for a random potential the resistivity has qualitatively different behavior because equipotential paths become increasingly tortuous as their width is reduced.

Our study is situated in the context of Gaussian quantum states, which are fundamental to both Bosonic and Fermionic systems and can be fully described by a covariance matrix. We show that while the covariance matrix is essential, it is insufficient alone for calculating Krylov complexity due to its lack of relative phase information. Our findings suggest that the relative covariance matrix can provide an upper bound for Krylov complexity for Gaussian quantum states.

The CFT operators of interest are the ""OPE blocks,"" contributions to the OPE from a single conformal family. In holographic theories, we show that the OPE blocks are dual at leading order in 1/N to integrals of effective bulk fields along geodesics or homogeneous minimal surfaces in anti-de Sitter space. One widely studied example of an OPE block is the modular Hamiltonian, which is dual to the fluctuation in the area of a minimal surface. Thus, our operators pave the way for generalizing the Ryu-Takayanagi relation to other bulk fields. Although the OPE blocks are non-local operators in the CFT, they admit a simple geometric description as fields in kinematic space--the space of pairs of CFT points.

In this paper, we perform a detailed analysis of the ground state Riemannian geometry induced by the metric tensor, using the quantum XY chain in a transverse field as our primary example. We focus on a particular geometric invariant -- the Gaussian curvature -- and show how both integrals of the curvature within a given phase and singularities of the curvature near phase transitions are protected by critical scaling theory. For cases where the curvature is integrable, we show that the integrated curvature provides a new geometric invariant, which like the Chern number characterizes individual phases of matter. For cases where the curvature is singular, we classify three types -- integrable, conical, and curvature singularities -- and detail situations where each type of singularity should arise. Finally, to connect this abstract geometry to experiment, we discuss three different methods for measuring the metric tensor, namely via integrating a properly weighted noise spectral function and by using leading order responses of the work distribution to ramps and quenches in quantum many-body systems.","2013-08-19","2020-12-15 09:24:53","2024-02-18 13:42:32","2020-12-15 09:24:53","064304","","6","88","","Phys.

For TFD states at t > 0, we demonstrate that the complexity evolves in time and saturates after a time of the order of the inverse temperature. The latter feature, which is in contrast with the results of holographic proposals, is due to the Gaussian nature of the TFD state of the free bosonic QFT. A novel technical aspect of our work is framing complexity calculations in the language of covariance matrices and the associated symplectic transformations, which provide a natural language for dealing with Gaussian states. Furthermore, for free QFTs in 1+1 dimension, we compare the dynamics of circuit complexity with the time dependence of the entanglement entropy for simple bipartitions of TFDs.

Explicit formulae are given for representations of Virasoro and affine algebras in terms of a local gauge choice on the line bundle associated with geometric quantization of a given coadjoint orbit; these formulae define a new set of explicit bosonic realizations of these algebras. The coadjoint orbit realizations take the form of dual Verma modules, making it possible to avoid the technical difficulties associated with the two-sided resolutions which arise from Feigin-Fuchs and Wakimoto realizations. Formulae are given for screening and intertwining operators on the coadjoint orbit representations. Chiral vertex operators between Virasoro modules are constructed, and related directly to Virasoro algebra generators in certain cases. From the point of view taken in this thesis, vertex operators have a geometric interpretation as differential operators taking sections of one line bundle to sections of another.

Inhomogeneous cost functions ---many examples of which have been recently proposed in the literature--- are ruled out by our analysis. Such measures are shown to be unrelated to circuit complexity in general and to produce severe violations of Lloyd's bound in simple situations. Among the metrics which do provide lower bounds, the idea is to select those which produce the tightest possible ones. This establishes a hierarchy of cost functions and considerably reduces the list of candidate complexity measures. In particular, the criterion suggests a canonical way of dealing with penalties, consisting in assigning infinite costs to directions not belonging to the gate set. We discuss how this can be implemented through the use of Lagrange multipliers. We argue that one of the surviving cost functions defines a particularly canonical notion in the sense that: i) it straightforwardly follows from the standard Hermitian metric in Hilbert space; ii) its associated complexity functional is closely related to Kirillov's coadjoint orbit action, providing an explicit realization of the ``complexity equals action'' idea; iii) it arises from a Hamilton-Jacobi analysis of the ``quantum action'' describing quantum dynamics in the phase space canonically associated to every Hilbert space.

Previously, it was shown that by choosing a suitable cost function, the resulting complexity functional is equivalent to geometric (group) actions on coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro group, up to a term that originates from the central extension. We show that this term can be recovered by modifying the cost function, making the equivalence exact. Moreover, we generalize our approach to Kac-Moody symmetry groups, finding again an exact equivalence between complexity functionals and geometric actions. We then determine the optimal circuits for these complexity measures and calculate the corresponding costs for several examples of optimal transformations. In the Virasoro case, we find that for all choices of reference state except for the vacuum state, the complexity only measures the cost associated to phase changes, while assigning zero cost to the non-phase changing part of the transformation. For Kac-Moody groups in contrast, there do exist non-trivial optimal transformations beyond phase changes that contribute to the complexity, yielding a finite gauge invariant result. Furthermore, we also show that the alternative complexity proposal of path integral optimization is equivalent to the Virasoro proposal studied here. Finally, we sketch a new proposal for a complexity definition for the Virasoro group that measures the cost associated to non-trivial transformations beyond phase changes. This proposal is based on a cost function given by a metric on the Lie group of conformal transformations. The minimization of the corresponding complexity functional is achieved using the Euler-Arnold method yielding the Korteweg-de Vries equation as equation of motion.","2020-11-04","2023-09-12 13:24:15","2024-02-18 13:41:43","","003","","","11","","JHEP","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1790458","","","71 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 63 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: Erdmenger:2020sup arXiv:2004.03619 [hep-th]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/V7FGDFP2/Erdmenger2020sup.pdf","","To Read","High Energy Physics - Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also introduce the concept of 'mode-by-mode purifications' where each mode in the mixed state is purified separately and examine the extent to which such purifications are optimal. We explore the purification complexity for thermal states of a free scalar QFT in any number of dimensions, and for subregions of the vacuum state in two dimensions. We compare our results to those found using the various holographic proposals for the complexity of subregions. We find a number of qualitative similarities between the two in terms of the structure of divergences and the presence of a volume law. We also examine the 'mutual complexity' in the various cases studied in this paper.","2020-03-03","2020-08-13 13:19:10","2024-02-18 13:41:51","2020-08-13 13:19:10","012","","3","03","","JHEP","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1755682","arXiv.org","","91 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 81 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) ZSCC: 0000018 Citation Key: Caceres:2019pgf arXiv:1909.10557 [hep-th]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/ZCKYL3E4/Caceres2019pgf.pdf","","","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology; High Energy Physics - Theory; Quantum Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This 2d-dimensional space naturally captures some of the fundamental nonlocality and causal structure inherent in the entanglement of CFT states. For any primary CFT operator, we construct an observable on this space, which is defined by smearing the associated one-point function over causal diamonds. Known examples of such quantities are the entanglement entropy of vacuum excitations and its higher spin generalizations. We show that in holographic CFTs, these observables are given by suitably defined integrals of dual bulk fields over the corresponding Ryu-Takayanagi minimal surfaces. Furthermore, we explain connections to the operator product expansion and the first law of entanglement entropy from this unifying point of view. We demonstrate that for small perturbations of the vacuum, our observables obey linear two-derivative equations of motion on the space of causal diamonds. In two dimensions, the latter is given by a product of two copies of a two-dimensional de Sitter space. For a class of universal states, we show that the entanglement entropy and its spin-three generalization obey nonlinear equations of motion with local interactions on this moduli space, which can be identified with Liouville and Toda equations, respectively. This suggests the possibility of extending the definition of our new observables beyond the linear level more generally and in such a way that they give rise to new dynamically interacting theories on the moduli space of causal diamonds.

We give an explicit formula for the volume of a general region in the spatial slice as an integral over kinematic space. For the region lying below a geodesic, we show how to write this volume purely in terms of entangling entropies in the dual CFT. This expression is perhaps most interesting in light of the complexity=volume proposal, which posits that complexity of holographic quantum states is computed by bulk volumes. An extension of this idea proposes that the holographic subregion complexity of an interval, defined as the volume under its Ryu-Takayanagi surface, is a measure of the complexity of the corresponding reduced density matrix.

A key concept is kinematic space: an auxiliary Lorentzian geometry whose metric is defined in terms of conditional mutual informations and which organizes the entanglement pattern of a CFT state. When the field theory has a holographic dual obeying the Ryu-Takayanagi proposal, kinematic space has a direct geometric meaning: it is the space of bulk geodesics studied in integral geometry. Lengths of bulk curves are computed by kinematic volumes, giving a precise entropic interpretation of the length of any bulk curve. We explain how basic geometric concepts -- points, distances and angles -- are reflected in kinematic space, allowing one to reconstruct a large class of spatial bulk geometries from boundary entanglement entropies. In this way, kinematic space translates between information theoretic and geometric descriptions of a CFT state. As an example, we discuss in detail the static slice of AdS$_3$ whose kinematic space is two-dimensional de Sitter space.","2015-10-27","2023-09-12 13:24:15","2024-02-18 13:42:25","","175","","","10","","JHEP","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1372114","","","206 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 191 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: Czech:2015qta arXiv:1505.05515 [hep-th] number: SU-ITP-15-07","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/RANXCLCM/Czech2015qta.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the other hand, it is known that there exists a precise relation between geometric actions and Berry phases defined in group representations. Motivated by these connections, we elaborate on a relation between circuit complexity and the group theoretic Berry phase. As the simplest setup relevant for holography, we discuss the case of two dimensional conformal field theories. In the large central charge limit, we identify the computational cost function with the Berry connection in the unitary representation of the Virasoro group. We then use the latter identification to express the Berry phase in terms of the Virasoro circuit complexity. The former can be seen as the holonomy of the Berry connection along the path in the group manifold which defines the protocol. In addition, we derive a proportionality relation between Virasoro circuit complexity and the logarithm of the inner product between a particularly chosen reference state and the prepared target state. In this sense, the logarithmic formula turns out to be approximating the complexity up to some additive constant if the building blocks of the circuit are taken to be the underlying symmetry gates. Predictions based on this formula have recently been shown to coincide with the holographic complexity proposals and the path integral optimization procedure. The found connections may therefore help to better understand such coincidences. We also discuss that our findings, put together with earlier observations, may suggest a connection between the Virasoro Berry phase and the complexity measure in the path integral optimization proposal.","2022-01-11","2023-09-12 13:24:15","2023-09-19 08:19:26","","025012","","2","105","","Phys.

Our proposal for quantifying state complexity is based on the Fubini-Study metric. It leads to counting the number of applications of each gate (infinitesimal generator) in the transformation, subject to a state-dependent metric. We minimize the defined complexity with respect to momentum preserving quadratic generators which form $\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$ algebras. On the manifold of Gaussian states generated by these operations the Fubini-Study metric factorizes into hyperbolic planes with minimal complexity circuits reducing to known geodesics.

Evolution of primary operators proceeds as a flow into the 'bath of descendants' of the Verma module. These descendants are labeled by integer partitions and have a one-to-one map to Young diagrams.

Our system is a harmonic oscillator coupled to a one-dimensional massless scalar field, which acts as the bath. Specifically, we consider the reduced density matrix by tracing out the bath degrees of freedom for both regular and inverted oscillator and computed the complexity of purification (COP) and complexity by using the operator-state mapping. We found that when the oscillator is regular the COP saturates quickly for both underdamped and overdamped oscillators. Interestingly, when the oscillator is underdamped, we discover a kink like behaviour for the saturation value of COP with varying damping coefficient. For the inverted oscillator, we found a linear growth of COP with time for all values of bath-system interaction. However, when the interaction is increased the slope of the linear growth decreases, implying that the unstable nature of the system can be regulated by the bath.","2022-02-15","2022-06-04 08:43:18","2024-02-18 13:41:24","2022-06-04 08:43:18","046011","","4","105","","Phys.

However,on several occasions, it has been argued that, even in integrable systems, OTOC can grow exponentially due to the presence of unstable saddle points in the phase space. In this work, we probe such an integrable system exhibiting saddle dominated scrambling through Krylov complexity and the associated Lanczos coefficients. In the realm of the universal operator growth hypothesis, we demonstrate that the Lanczos coefficients follow the linear growth, which ensures the exponential behavior of Krylov complexity at early times. The linear growth arises entirely due to the saddle, which dominates other phase-space points even away from itself. Our results reveal that the exponential growth of Krylov complexity can be observed in integrable systems with saddle-dominated scrambling and thus need not be associated with the presence of chaos.","2022-05-25","2022-05-27 08:14:20","2024-02-18 13:41:19","2022-05-27 08:14:20","174","","5","05","","JHEP","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2047359","arXiv.org","","63 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 56 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) arXiv:2203.03534 [quant-ph] Citation Key: Bhattacharjee:2022vlt","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/4U6FIKKM/Bhattacharjee2022vlt.pdf","","","Condensed Matter - Statistical Mechanics; Condensed Matter - Strongly Correlated Electrons; High Energy Physics - Theory; Quantum Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that, for an isolated quantum system which is also chaotic, the change in entropy is non-negative when the system is generically perturbed. Physical systems are, in general, highly interacting and are good examples of chaotic systems. We show our result by keeping track of the change in energy when the system is perturbed. Using an extremely fine-tuned perturbation, we can still lower the entropy. But fine-tuning the perturbation requires measurement of highly precise energy levels of the system.

We attribute this unexpected phenomenon to spontaneous rearrangement of the conventional Landau state beyond a critical point at which the {\it topological} stability of this state breaks down, leading to the formation of an interaction-induced flat band adjacent to the nominal Fermi surface. We demonstrate that beyond the critical point, the quasiparticle picture of such correlated Fermi systems still holds, since the damping of single-particle excitations remains small compared with the Fermi energy $T_F=p^2_F/2m_e$. A Pitaevskii-style equation for determination of the new quasiparticle momentum distribution $n_*({\bf p})$ is derived, which provides for explanation of the linear-in-$T$ behavior of the resistivity $\rho(T)$ found experimentally.

One of its new signatures is a large negative thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{\rm xy}$, which appears for dopings $p$ below the pseudogap critical doping $p^*$, but whose origin is as yet unknown. Because this large $\kappa_{\rm xy}$ is observed even in the undoped Mott insulator La$_2$CuO$_4$, it cannot come from charge carriers, these being localized at $p = 0$. Here we show that the thermal Hall conductivity of La$_2$CuO$_4$ is roughly isotropic, being nearly the same for heat transport parallel and normal to the CuO$_2$ planes, i.e. $\kappa_{\rm zy}(T) \approx \kappa_{\rm xy} (T)$. This shows that the Hall response must come from phonons, these being the only heat carriers able to move as easily normal and parallel to the planes . At $p > p^*$, in both La$_{\rm 1.6-x}$Nd$_{\rm 0.4}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ and La$_{\rm 1.8-x}$Eu$_{\rm 0.2}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ with $p = 0.24$, we observe no c-axis Hall signal, i.e. $\kappa_{\rm zy}(T) = 0$, showing that phonons have zero Hall response outside the pseudogap phase. The phonon Hall response appears immediately below $p^* = 0.23$, as confirmed by the large $\kappa_{\rm zy}(T)$ signal we find in La$_{1.6-x}$Nd$_{\rm 0.4}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ with $p = 0.21$. The microscopic mechanism by which phonons become chiral in cuprates remains to be identified. This mechanism must be intrinsic - from a coupling of phonons to their electronic environment - rather than extrinsic, from structural defects or impurities, as these are the same on both sides of $p^*$. This intrinsic phonon Hall effect provides a new window on quantum materials and it may explain the thermal Hall signal observed in other topologically nontrivial insulators.","2020-02-28","2020-03-04 08:24:11","2023-08-04 09:25:09","2020-03-04 08:24:11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 2003.00111","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/5TQLWX4P/grissonnanche2020.pdf","","","⛔ No INSPIRE recid found; Condensed Matter - Strongly Correlated Electrons; ⛔ No DOI found; Condensed Matter - Superconductivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gradually, it decreases as time goes on and eventually vanishes. Thus, the Stefan-Boltzmann law tells us that the black hole temperature, defined by the emission rate of the black hole energy, starts from zero temperature and reaches a maximum value at a critical time, and finally vanishes.

This infinite-dimensional group governs the space of states of zero temperature Fermi liquids and thereby allows us to write down a nonlinear, bosonized action that reproduces Landau's kinetic theory in the classical limit. Upon quantizing, we obtain a systematic effective field theory as an expansion in nonlinear and higher derivative corrections suppressed by the Fermi momentum $p_F$, without the need to introduce artificial momentum scales through, e.g., decomposition of the Fermi surface into patches. We find that Fermi liquid theory can essentially be thought of as a non-trivial representation of the Lie group of canonical transformations, bringing it within the fold of effective theories in many-body physics whose structure is determined by symmetries. We survey the benefits and limitations of this geometric formalism in the context of scaling, diagrammatic calculations, scattering and interactions, coupling to background gauge fields, etc. After setting up a path to extending this formalism to include superconducting and magnetic phases, as well as applications to the problem of non-Fermi liquids, we conclude with a discussion on possible future directions for Fermi surface physics, and more broadly, the usefulness of diffeomorphism groups in condensed matter physics.

Compared with the original concept of complexity based on the minimal number of gates required to construct the desired operation as a product, this geometrical approach amounts to a more concrete and computable definition, but its evaluation is nontrivial in systems with a high-dimensional Hilbert space. The geometrical formulation can more easily be evaluated by considering the geometry associated with a suitable finite-dimensional group generated by a small number of relevant operators of the system. In this way, the method has been applied in particular to the harmonic oscillator, which is also of interest in the present paper. However, subtle and previously unrecognized issues of group theory can lead to unforeseen complications, motivating a new formulation that remains on the level of the underlying Lie algebras for most of the required steps. Novel insights about complexity can thereby be found in a low-dimensional setting, with the potential of systematic extensions to higher dimensions as well as interactions. Specific examples include the quantum complexity of various target unitary operators associated with a harmonic oscillator, inverted harmonic oscillator, and coupled harmonic oscillators. The generality of this approach is demonstrated by an application to an anharmonic oscillator with a cubic term.","2023-07-25","2023-08-01 08:03:33","2023-08-04 09:24:40","2023-08-01 08:03:33","","","","","","arXiv:2307.13736 [quant-ph]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2681689","arXiv.org","","0 citations (INSPIRE 2023/8/1) 0 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2023/8/1) arXiv:2307.13736 [quant-ph] Citation Key: Chowdhury:2023iwg","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/P7SQ2VED/Chowdhury2023iwg.pdf","","","High Energy Physics - Theory; Quantum Physics; Mathematical Physics; ⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A general method for finding classical limits in arbitrary quantum theories is developed. The method is based on certain assumptions which isolate the minimal structure any quantum theory should possess if it is to have a classical limit. In any theory satisfying these assumptions, one can generate a natural set of generalized coherent states. These coherent states may then be used to construct a classical phase space, derive a classical Hamiltonian, and show that the resulting classical dynamics is equivalent to the limiting form of the original quantum dynamics. This formalism is shown to be applicable to the large N limits of vector models, matrix models, and gauge theories. In every case, one can explicitly derive a classical action which contains the complete physics of the N=∞ theory. ""Solving"" the N=∞ theory requires minimizing the classical Hamiltonian, and this has been possible only in simple theories. The relation between this approach and other methods which have been proposed for deriving large N limits is discussed in detail.","1982","2020-02-07 13:27:39","2024-02-18 13:43:13","2020-02-07 13:27:39","407","","2","54","","Rev.

In this paper, the classification of orbits is reconsidered, with an explicit description of the possible centralizers of coadjoint orbits. The possible orbits are diff(S1) itself, diff(S1)/S1, and diff(S1)/SL(n)(2,R), withSL(n)(2,R) a certain discrete series of embeddings ofSL(2,R) in diff(S1), and diffS1/T, whereT may be any of certain rather special one parameter subgroups of diffS1. An attempt is made to clarify the relation between orbits and representations. It appears that quantization of diffS1/S1 is related to unitary representations with nondegenerate Kac determinant (unitary Verma modules), while quantization of diffS1/SL(n)(2,R) is seemingly related to unitary representations with null vectors in leveln. A better understanding of how to quantize the relevant orbits might lead to a better geometrical understanding of Virasoro representation theory. In the process of investigating Virasoro coadjoint orbits, we observe the existence of left invariant symplectic structures on the Virasoro group manifold. As is described in an appendix, these give rise to Lie bialgebra structures with the Virasoro algebra as the underlying Lie algebra.","1988","2020-02-07 11:38:46","2024-02-18 13:43:09","2020-02-07 11:38:46","1","","1","114","","Commun.

We center our discussion around adiabatic gauge potentials, which are the generators of unitary basis transformations in quantum systems and generators of special canonical transformations in classical systems. In quantum systems, eigenstate expectation values of these potentials are the Berry connections and the covariance matrix of these gauge potentials is the geometric tensor, whose antisymmetric part defines the Berry curvature and whose symmetric part is the Fubini-Study metric tensor. In classical systems one simply replaces the eigenstate expectation value by an average over the micro-canonical shell. For complicated interacting systems, we show that a variational principle may be used to derive approximate gauge potentials. We then express the non-adiabatic response of the physical observables of the system through these gauge potentials, specifically demonstrating the close connection of the geometric tensor to the notions of Lorentz force and renormalized mass. We highlight applications of this formalism to deriving counter-diabatic (dissipationless) driving protocols in various systems, as well as to finding equations of motion for slow macroscopic parameters coupled to fast microscopic degrees of freedom that go beyond macroscopic Hamiltonian dynamics.

"DSII43AW","thesis","2011","Vichi, Alessandro","A New Method to Explore Conformal Field Theories in Any Dimension","","","","","https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/167898","The thesis represents an investigation into Conformal Field Theories (CFT's) in arbitrary dimensions. We propose an innovative method to extract informations about CFT's in a quantitative way. Studying the crossing symmetry of the four point function of scalar operators we derive consistency constraints on the CFT structure, in the form of functional sum rules. The technique we introduce allows to address the feasibility of the sum rule and translate it into restrictions on the CFT spectrum and interactions. Our analysis only assumes unitarity of the CFT, crossing symmetry of the four point function and existence of an Operator Product Expansion (OPE) for scalars. We demonstrate that a CFT satisfying the above hypothesis and containing a scalar operator is not compatible with arbitrary spectra of the operators nor with arbitrary large OPE coefficients. More specifically we prove two main results. First, the spectrum of the CFT must contain a second scalar operator with dimension smaller than a given value. Second, the value of the three point function of two scalars with equal dimension and a third arbitrary operator is bounded from above. As an application of the fist statement we present the bound on the smallest dimension operator entering the OPE of a real scalar with itself. We perform the analysis in two and four dimensions. The comparison of the two dimensional case with exactly solvable models shows a saturation of the bound. We repeat for CFT's with global symmetries and superconformal field theories in four dimensions. As a demonstration of the second result we provide a lower bound on the central charge for CFT in two and four dimensions without global symmetries and for superconformal field theories. We also discuss in the potentialities of the method and possible future research lines. Finally, we discuss possible implications for model building beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.","2011","2020-10-27 08:29:29","2023-09-19 08:16:11","2020-10-27 08:29:29","","","","","","","","","","","","École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne","","en","","PhD Thesis","","","","","ZSCC: 0000016 tex.ids= Vichi2011, Vichi:2011zza DOI: 10.5075/epfl-thesis-5116 number: THESIS publisher: EPFL","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/QDV3YEC3/vichi2011.pdf","","","⛔ No INSPIRE recid found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also characterize the antiferromagnetic phase and an externally forced ferromagnetic phase by showing that they contain the expected spin waves with linear and quadratic dispersions respectively.","2010","2020-11-03 13:56:00","2024-02-18 13:42:44","2020-11-03 13:56:00","045002","","4","82","","Phys.

Moreover, the Yukawa coupling results in rearrangements of the spectrum at low frequency region but the density of states (DOS) for all Yukawa coupling parameter tend to the same value at the high frequency region, which is different from the well studied case with dipole coupling.

This implies that collective excitations of the liquid (a sound mode) are carrying heat.

In the hydrodynamic regime of metals, momentum relaxes slowly with a rate $\Gamma$, which formally appears on the right-hand side of the momentum dynamical equation and causes a Drude-like peak in the frequency dependence of the thermoelectric conductivities. Here we study the structure and determine the physical implications of momentum-relaxing gradient corrections beyond Drude, i.e. arising at subleading order in the gradient expansion. We find that they effectively renormalize the weight of the Drude pole in the thermoelectric conductivities, and contribute to the dc conductivities at the same order as previously-known gradient corrections of translation-invariant hydrodynamics. Turning on a magnetic field, extra derivative corrections appear and renormalize the cyclotron frequency and the Hall conductivity. This relaxed hydrodynamics provides a field-theoretic explanation for previous results obtained using gauge-gravity duality. In strongly-coupled metals where quasiparticles are short-lived and which may be close to a hydrodynamic regime, the extra contributions we discuss are essential to interpret experimentally measured magneto-thermoelectric conductivities. They also cause a different dependence on doping in the effective mass deduced from the specific heat and from measurements of the cyclotron frequency, which do not agree in cuprate superconductors. More generally, we expect such terms to be present in any hydrodynamic theory with approximate symmetries, which arise in many physical systems.","2023-09-07","2023-09-13 12:36:48","2024-02-18 13:40:49","2023-09-13 12:36:48","","","","","","arXiv:2309.04033 [hep-th]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2695431","arXiv.org","","2 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 2 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) arXiv:2309.04033 [hep-th] Citation Key: Gouteraux:2023uff","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/XNHFSPXY/Gouteraux2023uff.pdf","","","Condensed Matter - Strongly Correlated Electrons; High Energy Physics - Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The magnitude of S/T in the T=0 limit is found to suddenly increase, by a factor ≃5, when the doping is reduced below p★=0.23, the critical doping for the onset of the pseudogap phase. This confirms that the pseudogap phase causes a large reduction of the carrier density n, consistent with a drop from n=1+p above p★ to n=p below p★, as previously inferred from measurements of the Hall coefficient, resistivity, and thermal conductivity. When the doping is reduced below p=0.19, a qualitative change is observed whereby S/T decreases as T→0, eventually to reach negative values at T=0. In prior work on other cuprates, negative values of S/T at T→0 were shown to result from a reconstruction of the Fermi surface caused by charge density wave (CDW) order. We therefore identify pCDW≃0.19 as the critical doping beyond which there is no CDW-induced Fermi surface reconstruction. The fact that pCDW is well separated from p★ reveals that there is a doping range below p★ where the transport signatures of the pseudogap phase are unaffected by CDW correlations, as previously found in YBa2Cu3Oy and La2−xSrxCuO4.","2021-04-01","2022-10-27 09:00:23","2024-02-18 13:41:37","2023-09-12 14:01:06","155102","","15","103","","Phys.

Here, we review a class of materials, known as \lq strange' metals, that can violate both principles. In materials exhibiting such behavior, the change in slope of the resistivity as the mean free path drops below the lattice constant, or as $T \rightarrow 0$, can be imperceptible, suggesting complete continuity between the charge carriers at low and high $T$. Since particles cannot scatter at length scales shorter than the interatomic spacing, strange metallicity calls into question the relevance of locality and a particle picture of the underlying current. This review focuses on transport and spectroscopic data on candidate strange metals with an eye to isolate and identify a unifying physical principle. Special attention is paid to quantum criticality, Planckian dissipation, Mottness, and whether a new gauge principle, which has a clear experimental signature, is needed to account for the non-local transport seen in strange metals. For the cuprates, strange metallicity is shown to track the superfluid density, thereby making a theory of this state the primary hurdle in solving the riddle of high-temperature superconductivity.","2022-07-08","2022-10-27 08:33:00","2024-02-18 13:41:16","2022-10-27 08:32:59","abh4273","","6602","377","","Science","","","","","","","","en","","","INSPIRE","2087958","DOI.org (Crossref)","","14 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 13 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: Phillips:2022nxs tex.ids= phillipsStrangerMetals2022 arXiv:2205.12979 [cond-mat.str-el] tex.eprint: 2205.12979 publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/8NR7S7B6/Phillips2022nxs.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we construct a consistent hydrodynamic description for fluids invariant under translation, rotation, and dipole shift symmetry. We use symmetry principles to formulate a thermodynamic theory for dipole-conserving systems at equilibrium and apply irreversible thermodynamics in order to elucidate dissipative effects. Remarkably, we find that the inclusion of the energy conservation not only renders the longitudinal modes diffusive rather than subdiffusive but also diffusion is present even at the lowest order in the derivative expansion.

This paper introduces FiniteFieldSolve, a general-purpose toolkit for exactly solving large linear systems over the rationals. The solver interfaces directly with Mathematica, is straightforward to install, and seamlessly replaces Mathematica's native solvers. In testing, FiniteFieldSolve is approximately two orders of magnitude faster than Mathematica and uses an order of magnitude less memory. The package also compares favorably against other public solvers in FiniteFieldSolve's intended use cases. As the name of the package suggests, solutions are obtained via well-known finite field methods. These methods suffer from introducing an inordinate number of modulo (or integer division) operations with respect to different primes. By automatically recompiling itself for each prime, FiniteFieldSolve converts the division operations into much faster combinations of instructions, dramatically improving performance. The technique of compiling the prime can be applied to any finite field solver, where the time savings will be solver dependent. The operation of the package is illustrated through a detailed example of an amplitude bootstrap.","2023-11-02","2023-11-06 08:34:46","2023-11-06 08:34:47","2023-11-06 08:34:46","","","","","","arXiv:2311.01671 [hep-th]","FiniteFieldSolve","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2718838","arXiv.org","","0 citations (INSPIRE 2023/11/6) 0 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2023/11/6) arXiv:2311.01671 [hep-th] Citation Key: Mangan:2023eeb","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/5V72Z85Q/Mangan2023eeb.pdf","","","High Energy Physics - Theory; High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we construct the relativistic generalization of these equations via gradient expansion for a fluid with a conserved charge in a curved $d$-dimensional spacetime. We follow a general hydrodynamic frame approach and introduce the irreducible structure (IS) algorithm, which is based on derivatives of the expansion scalar and the shear and vorticity tensors. In this manner, we systematically generate all permissible gradients up to a specified order and derive the most comprehensive constitutive relations for a charged fluid, accurate up to third-order gradients. The constitutive relations are formulated to both ordinary, non-conformal, and conformal-invariant charged fluids. We also examine the hydrodynamic frame dependence of the transport coefficients for a non-conformal charged fluid up to third order in the gradient expansion. The frame dependence of the scalar, vector, and tensor parts of the constitutive relations is obtained in terms of the field redefinitions of the fundamental hydrodynamic variables. These frame dependencies are challenging to manage due to their non-linear character. In the linear regime, however, these higher-order transformations become tractable, allowing us to identify frame-invariant transport coefficients. One advantage of employing these coefficients is the possibility of studying linear equations of motion in any chosen frame; so, we do it in the Landau frame. Subsequently, these linear equations are solved in momentum space, yielding dispersion relations for shear, sound, and diffusive modes in a non-conformal charged fluid, in terms of the frame-invariant transport coefficients.","2023-11-02","2023-11-03 11:03:23","2023-11-03 11:03:29","2023-11-03 11:03:23","","","","","","arXiv:2311.01232 [hep-th]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2717836","arXiv.org","","0 citations (INSPIRE 2023/11/3) 0 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2023/11/3) arXiv:2311.01232 [hep-th] Citation Key: Diles:2023tau","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/R4J4VDEQ/Diles2023tau.pdf","","","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology; High Energy Physics - Theory; High Energy Physics - Phenomenology; Nuclear Theory; Physics - Fluid Dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For particles in a thermal environment and driven by non-conservative forces, we show that the entropy production rate can be upper bounded by considering only the statistics of the driven particles. We use this finding to argue that the presence of non-driven, passive degrees of freedom generally leads to decreased dissipation. Another upper bound can be obtained only in terms of the variance of the non-conservative force, which leads to a universal upper bound for particles that are driven by a constant force that is applied in a certain region of space. Extending our results to systems attached to multiple heat baths or with spatially varying temperature and/or mobility, we show that the temperature difference between the heat baths or the gradient of the temperature can be used to upper bound the entropy production rate.

The main technical result is showing that, for arbitrary Hamiltonians, the generators of partial versions of the Wigner, Husimi and Glauber-Sudarshan quasiprobability distributions may all be mapped in the above double scaling limit to the same completely-positive classical-quantum generator.

One useful organizing principle characterizing equilibration is the dissipative universality class, the most prevalent one being diffusion. In this paper, we use the effective field theory (EFT) of diffusion to systematically obtain universal power-law corrections to diffusion. We then employ large-scale simulations of classical and quantum systems to explore their validity. In particular, we find universal scaling functions for the corrections to the dynamical structure factor $\langle n(x,t)n\rangle$, in the presence of a single $U(1)$ or $SU(2)$ charge in systems with and without particle-hole symmetry, and present the framework to generalize the calculation to multiple charges. Classical simulations show remarkable agreement with EFT predictions for subleading corrections, pushing precision tests of effective theories for thermalizing systems to an unprecedented level. Moving to quantum systems, we perform large-scale tensor-network simulations in unitary and noisy 1d Floquet systems with conserved magnetization. We find a qualitative agreement with EFT which becomes quantitative in the case of noisy systems. Additionally, we show how the knowledge of EFT corrections allows for fitting methods, which can improve the estimation of transport parameters at the intermediate times accessible by simulations and experiments. Finally, we explore non-linear response in quantum systems and find that EFT provides an accurate prediction for its behavior.

The $T$-linear scaling originates from nonclassical hydrodynamics in 2D Fermi systems governed by long-lived excitations and non-Newtonian viscous modes. This behavior stands in sharp contrast with the conventional Gurzhi hydrodynamics in 3D systems that features a $T^2$ scaling of conductivity. The linear $T$ dependence, predicted to occur in a wide range of temperatures, provides a smoking gun for nonclassical hydrodynamics.

This theory is topological, meaning the physical degrees of freedom are all located on the boundary. The boundary description on a torus can be derived, and it takes the form of a 2D Schwarzian theory. This suggests that the relevant degrees of freedom for the theory can be described by this 2D theory. Because of the renormalizability of the 3D gravity theory, one can probe the quantum regime. This implies that one can study quantum effects. Unlike the conventional CFTs, when considering the AdS$_3$ background, the boundary theory loses modular symmetry. This is an interesting departure from the conventional CFT behavior. The Weyl transformation induces anomaly in CFTs, and we indicate that applying this transformation to the 2D Schwarzian theory leads to similar results. Summing over all geometries with the asymptotic AdS$_3$ boundary condition is equivalent to summing over a modular group. The partition function is one-loop exact and therefore an analytical expression from the summation. Finally, we hint at the possible applications of this theory in Quantum Information, which is a common theme in the study of holography, where gravitational theories are related to CFTs.","2023-10-06","2023-10-10 08:08:44","2024-02-18 13:40:44","2023-10-10 08:08:44","","","","","","","AdS$_3$ Einstein Gravity and Boundary Description","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","0 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 0 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) arXiv:2310.04665 null","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/GHPND3MG/ma2023.pdf","","","High Energy Physics - Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We first show, under general assumptions, that such a system can be brought to a Schrödinger-like form. We then devise an analytic approximation scheme to compute the spectrum of quasinormal modes. We validate our approach using a toy model with a controllable mixing parameter $\varepsilon$ and showing that the analytic approximation for the fundamental mode agrees with the numerical computation when the approximation is justified. The accuracy of the analytic approximation is at the (sub-) percent level for the real part and at the level of a few percent for the imaginary part, even when $\varepsilon$ is of order one.

By studying their Fisher metrics, we derive some general lessons that may have important implications for the application of information geometry in holography. We begin by demonstrating that the symmetries of the physical theory under study play a strong role in the resulting geometry, and that the appearance of an AdS metric is a relatively general feature. We then investigate what information the Fisher metric retains about the physics of the underlying theory by studying the geometry for both the classical 2d Ising model and the corresponding 1d free fermion theory, and find that the curvature diverges precisely at the phase transition on both sides. We discuss the differences that result from placing a metric on the space of theories vs. states, using the example of coherent free fermion states. We compare the latter to the metric on the space of coherent free boson states and show that in both cases the metric is determined by the symmetries of the corresponding density matrix. We also clarify some misconceptions in the literature pertaining to different notions of flatness associated to metric and non-metric connections, with implications for how one interprets the curvature of the geometry.

By applying the constraints for a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) and by using the concept of BH effective state, previously introduced by one of the authors (CC), the BH quantum gravitational potential, Schrodinger equation and the BH energy spectrum are found. Remarkably, such an energy spectrum is in agreement (in its absolute value) with the one which was conjectured by Bekenstein in 1974 and consistent with other ones in the literature. This approach also permits to find an interesting quantum representation of the Schwarzschild BH ground state at the Planck scale. Moreover, two fundamental issues about BH quantum physics are addressed by this model: the area quantization and the singularity resolution. As regards the former, a result similar to the one obtained by Bekenstein, but with a different coefficient, has been found. About the latter, it is shown that the traditional classical singularity in the core of the Schwarzschild BH is replaced, in a full quantum treatment, by a two-particle system where the two components strongly interact with each other via a quantum gravitational potential. The two-particle system seems to be non-singular from the quantum point of view and is analogous to the hydrogen atom because it consists of a ""nucleus"" and an ""electron"".","2020-01-26","2020-02-11 14:05:17","2023-10-09 07:44:20","2020-02-11 14:05:17","","","","","","arXiv:1912.06478 [gr-qc]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1770774","arXiv.org","","7 citations (INSPIRE 2023/8/4) 4 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2023/8/4) arXiv:1912.06478 [gr-qc] Citation Key: Corda:2019vuk","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/MQWJ9MIF/Corda2019vuk.pdf","","","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology; High Energy Physics - Theory; ⛔ No DOI found; Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"C33DBA9Z","journalArticle","2019","Cresswell, Jesse C.","Quantum Information Approaches to Quantum Gravity","","","","","http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13347","In this thesis we apply techniques from quantum information theory to study quantum gravity within the framework of the anti-de Sitter / conformal field theory correspondence (AdS/CFT). Through AdS/CFT, progress has been made in understanding the structure of entanglement in quantum field theories, and in how gravitational physics can emerge from these structures. However, this understanding is far from complete and will require the development of new tools to quantify correlations in CFT. This thesis presents refinements of a duality between operator product expansion (OPE) blocks in the CFT, giving the contribution of a conformal family to the OPE, and geodesic integrated fields in AdS which are diffeomorphism invariant quantities. This duality was originally discovered in the maximally symmetric setting of pure AdS dual to the CFT ground state. In less symmetric states the duality must be modified. Working with excited states within AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, this thesis shows how the OPE block decomposes into more fine-grained CFT observables that are dual to AdS fields integrated over non-minimal geodesics. Additionally, this thesis contains results on the dynamics of entanglement measures for general quantum systems. Results are presented for the family of quantum R\'enyi entropies and entanglement negativity. R\'enyi entropies are studied for general dynamics by imposing special initial conditions. Around pure, separable initial states, all R\'enyi entropies grow with the same timescale at leading, and next-to-leading order. Mathematical tools are developed for the differentiation of non-analytic matrix functions with respect to constrained arguments and are used to construct analytic expressions for derivatives of negativity. We establish bounds on the rate of change of state distinguishability and the rate of entanglement growth for closed systems.

We study both cases where the unitaries are chosen with and without a conserved $U(1)$ charge and focus on two aspects of the dynamics. First, we study analytically and numerically the growth of the entanglement entropy of the system, showing that two different time scales appear: one is intrinsic to the internal dynamics (the scrambling time), while the other depends on the system-environment coupling. In the presence of a $U(1)$ conserved charge, we show that the entanglement follows a Page-like behavior in time: it begins to decrease in the middle stage of the ""evaporation"", and decreases monotonically afterwards.

As the matter fields we consider $N$ massless free scalar fields ($N$ is large). We find a spherically symmetric self-consistent solution of the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ and state $|\psi\rangle$. Here, $g_{\mu\nu}$ is locally $AdS_2\times S^2$ geometry, and $|\psi\rangle$ provides $\langle \psi|T_{\mu\nu}|\psi \rangle=\langle0|T_{\mu\nu}|0 \rangle+T_{\mu\nu}^{(\psi)}$, where $|0\rangle$ is the ground state of the matter fields in the metric and $T_{\mu\nu}^{(\psi)}$ consists of the excitation of s-waves that describe the collapsing matter and Hawking radiation with the ingoing negative energy flow. This object is supported by a large tangential pressure $\langle0|T^\theta{}_\theta|0 \rangle$ due to the vacuum fluctuation of the bound modes with large angular momenta. This describes the interior of the black hole when the back reaction of the evaporation is considered. The black hole is a compact object with a surface (instead of horizon) that looks like a conventional black hole from the outside and eventually evaporates without a singularity. If we count the number of self-consistent configurations $\{|\psi\rangle\}$, we reproduce the area law of the entropy. This tells that the information is carried by the s-waves inside the black hole. $|\psi\rangle$ also describes the process that the negative ingoing energy flow created with Hawking radiation is superposed on the collapsing matter to decrease the total energy while the total energy density remains positive. As a special case, we consider conformal matter fields and show that the interior metric is determined by the matter content of the theory, which leads to a new constraint to the matter content.","2020-06-04","2020-02-26 11:10:01","2023-10-09 07:44:02","2020-02-26 11:10:01","77","","6","6","","Universe","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1781974","arXiv.org","","18 citations (INSPIRE 2023/10/2) 10 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2023/10/2) arXiv:2002.10331 [hep-th] Citation Key: Kawai:2020rmt","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/68SF7LD4/Kawai2020rmt.pdf","","","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology; High Energy Physics - Theory; High Energy Physics - Phenomenology; Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In college, we learned that there are much more than four states of matter. For example, there are ferromagnetic states as revealed by the phenomenon of magnetization and superfluid states as defined by the phenomenon of zero-viscosity. The various phases in our colorful world are so rich that it is amazing that they can be understood systematically by the symmetry breaking theory of Landau. In this paper, we will review the progress in last 20 -- 30 years, during which we discovered that there are even more interesting phases that are beyond Landau symmetry breaking theory. We discuss new ""topological"" phenomena, such as topological degeneracy, that reveal the existence of those new phases - topologically ordered phases. Just like zero-viscosity defines the superfluid order, the new ""topological"" phenomena define the topological order at macroscopic level. As a new type of order, topological order requires a new mathematical frame work, such as fusion category and group cohomology, to describe it. More recently, we find that, at microscopical level, topological order is due to long-range quantum entanglements, just like fermion superfluid is due to fermion-pair condensation. Long-range quantum entanglements lead to many amazing emergent phenomena, such as fractional quantum numbers, fractional/non-Abelian statistics, and perfect conducting boundary channels. Long-range quantum entanglements can even provide a unified origin of light and electrons (or more generally, gauge interactions and Fermi statistics): light waves (gauge fields) are fluctuations of long-range entanglements, and electrons (fermions) are defects of long-range entanglements.","2013","2020-04-30 13:55:24","2024-02-18 13:42:33","2020-04-30 13:55:24","198710","","","2013","","ISRN Cond.

We address the following questions of such a finite density system: 1. Does the system have a Fermi surface? What are the properties of low energy excitations near the Fermi surface? 2. Does the system have an instability to condensation of scalar operators? What is the critical behavior near the corresponding quantum critical point? We find interesting parallels with those of high T_c cuprates and heavy electron systems. Playing a crucial role in our discussion is a universal intermediate-energy phase, called a ""semi-local quantum liquid"", which underlies the non-Fermi liquid and novel quantum critical behavior of a system.

The Curie temperature of MnSi is 29.5 K at ambient pressure, but vanishes above a critical pressure of 14.6 kbar. MnSi shows a first order quantum phase transition from a ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic phase. In its normal state, MnSi displays an enigmatic T 3/2 low-temperature dependence of the resistivity, defying the T 2 law that follows from Landau’s Fermi liquid theory, the “standard model for metals”. After reviewing Landau’s Fermi liquid theory, this paper emphasizes the possible routes that might lead to its breakdown. The goal is to understand the non-Fermi-liquid phase of MnSi. High- precision measurements of its electrical transport and magnetic properties, as well as neutron scattering experiments are discussed. Finally, various evidence of spontaneous skyrmion ground states in MnSi is presented. The presence of such states could explain the peculiar T 3/2 power law dependence.","2008","2020-05-06 08:14:57","2023-10-09 07:43:50","","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","ZSCC: 0000000","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/XGEQLIWD/berceanu2008.pdf","","To Read","⛔ No DOI found; ⛔ No INSPIRE recid found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pseudogap physics of the underdoped regime appears as a consequence of the altered statistics and the profound question is how to connect this by a continuous quantum phase transition to the overdoped regime ruled by normal Fermi-Dirac statistics.

The standard picture of Fermi liquids is first critically analyzed, pointing out some of its rather peculiar properties. The insightful work of Ceperley in constructing fermionic path integrals in terms of constrained world-lines is then reviewed. In this representation, the minus signs associated with Fermi-Dirac statistics are self consistently translated into a geometrical constraint structure (the {\em nodal hypersurface}) acting on an effective bosonic dynamics. As an illustrative example we use this formalism to study 1+1-dimensional systems, where statistics are irrelevant, and hence the sign problem can be circumvented. In this low-dimensional example, the structure of the nodal constraints leads to a lucid picture of the entropic interaction essential to one-dimensional physics. Working with the path integral in momentum space, we then show that the Fermi gas can be understood by analogy to a Mott insulator in a harmonic trap. Going back to real space, we discuss the topological properties of the nodal cells, and suggest a new holographic conjecture relating Fermi liquids in higher dimensions to soft-core bosons in one dimension.

Only recently, it has been suggested that fermion signs are fundamental for the universal behavior of critical metallic systems and crucially enhance their degree of quantum entanglement. In this work we explore potential connections between emergent scale invariance of fermion sign structures and scaling properties of bipartite entanglement entropies. Our analysis is based on a wavefunction ansatz that incorporates collective, long-range backflow correlations into fermionic Slater determinants. Such wavefunctions mimic the collapse of a Fermi liquid at a quantum critical point. Their nodal surfaces -- a representation of the fermion sign structure in many-particle configurations space -- show fractal behavior up to a length scale $\xi$ that diverges at a critical backflow strength. We show that the Hausdorff dimension of the fractal nodal surface depends on $\xi$, the number of fermions and the exponent of the backflow. For the same wavefunctions we numerically calculate the second R\'enyi entanglement entropy $S_2$. Our results show a cross-over from volume scaling, $S_2\sim \ell^\theta$ ($\theta=2$ in $d=2$ dimensions), to the characteristic Fermi-liquid behavior $S_2\sim \ell\ln \ell$ on scales larger than $\xi$. We find that volume scaling of the entanglement entropy is a robust feature of critical backflow fermions, independent of the backflow exponent and hence the fractal dimension of the scale invariant sign structure.","2017-04-03","2020-05-28 08:41:53","2024-02-18 13:42:18","2020-06-16 14:24:11","155102","","15","95","","Phys.

Such a single-hole wave function possesses finite angular momenta generated by hidden spin currents, which give rise to a novel ground state degeneracy in agreement with recent exact diagonalization (ED) and density matrix renormalization group (DMGR) results. We further show that the wave function can be decomposed into a quasiparticle component and an incoherent momentum distribution in excellent agreement with the DMRG results up to an $8\times 8 $ lattice. Such a two-component structure indicates the breakdown of Landau's one-to-one correspondence principle, and in particular, the quasiparticle spectral weight vanishes by a power law in the large sample-size limit. By contrast, turning off the phase string induced by the hole hopping in the so-called $\sigma\cdot t\text{-}J$ model, a conventional Bloch-wave wave function with a finite quasiparticle spectral weight can be recovered, also in agreement with the ED and DMRG results. The present study shows that a singular effect already takes place in the single-hole-doped Mott insulator, by which the bare hole is turned into a non-Landau quasiparticle with translational symmetry breaking.

Concepts and tools in quantum information science such as entanglement, quantum circuits, and the tensor network representation prove to be highly useful in studying such systems. The goal of this book is to introduce these techniques and show how they lead to a new systematic way of characterizing and classifying quantum phases in condensed matter systems. The first part of the book introduces some basic concepts in quantum information theory which are then used to study the central topic explained in Part II: local Hamiltonians and their ground states. Part III focuses on one of the major new phenomena in strongly interacting systems, the topological order, and shows how it can essentially be defined and characterized in terms of entanglement. Part IV shows that the key entanglement structure of topological states can be captured using the tensor network representation, which provides a powerful tool in the classification of quantum phases. Finally, Part V discusses the exciting prospect at the intersection of quantum information and condensed matter physics - the unification of information and matter.

It begins with the simplest examples-hydrogen and oxygen molecules-based on their effective Hamiltonians, and looks into basic properties of electrons in solids from the perspective of localized and itinerant limits. Readers will also learn about basic theoretical methods such as the linear response theory and Green functions. The second part focuses on mean-field theory for itinerant electrons, e.g. the Fermi liquid theory and superconductivity. Coulomb repulsion among electrons is addressed in the context of high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates and iron pnictides. A recent discovery concerning hydride superconductors is also briefly reviewed. In turn, the third part highlights quantum fluctuation effects beyond the mean-field picture. Discussing the dramatic renormalization effect in the Kondo physics, it provides a clear understanding of nonperturbative interaction effects. Further it introduces readers to fractionally charged quasi-particles in one and two dimensions. The last chapter addresses the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT).

The book combines theoretical evaluations with arguments based on experimental grounds demonstrating that the entirety of very different strongly correlated Fermi systems demonstrates a universal behavior induced by FCQPT. In contrast to the conventional quantum phase transition, whose physics in the quantum critical region are dominated by thermal or quantum fluctuations and characterized by the absence of quasiparticles, the physics of a Fermi system near FCQPT are controlled by a system of quasiparticles resembling the Landau quasiparticles. The book discusses the modification of strongly correlated systems under the action of FCQPT, representing the “missing” instability, which paves the way for developing an entirely new approach to condensed matter theory; and presents this physics as a new method for studying many-body objects.

I then describe the modern discovery of physics beyond the standard model. Here, quantum correlations (entanglement) and topology play key roles in defining the properties of matter. This can lead to fractionalised quasiparticles that carry only a fraction of the quantum numbers that define fundamental particles. These particles can have exotic properties: for example Majorana fermions are their own antiparticles, anyons have exchange statistics that are neither bosonic nor fermionic, and magnetic monopoles do not occur in the vacuum.

In the classical limit of this theory, general relativity as described by the Einstein field equations is obtained. This limit, where classical general relativity is derived from quantum field theory is the topic of this thesis. The Schwarzschild-Tangherlini metric, which describes the gravitational field of an inertial point particle in arbitrary space-time dimensions, $D$, is analyzed. The metric is related to the three-point vertex function of a massive scalar interacting with a graviton to all orders in $G_N$, and the one-loop contribution to this amplitude is computed from which the $G_N^2$ contribution to the metric is derived. To understand the gauge-dependence of the metric, covariant gauge is used which introduces the parameter, $\xi$, and the gauge-fixing function $G_\sigma$. In the classical limit, the gauge-fixing function turns out to be the coordinate condition, $G_\sigma=0$. As gauge-fixing function a novel family of gauges, which depends on an arbitrary parameter $\alpha$ and includes both harmonic and de Donder gauge, is used. Feynman rules for the graviton field are derived and important results are the graviton propagator in covariant gauge and a general formula for the n-graviton vertex in terms of the Einstein tensor. The Feynman rules are used both in deriving the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini metric from amplitudes and in the computation of the one-loop correction to the metric. The one-loop correction to the metric is independent of the covariant gauge parameter, $\xi$, and satisfies the gauge condition $G_\sigma=0$ where $G_\sigma$ is the family of gauges depending on $\alpha$. In space-time $D=5$ a logarithm appears in position space and this phenomena is analyzed in terms of redundant gauge freedom.","2020-10-17","2020-10-20 09:22:49","2024-02-18 13:41:44","2020-10-20 09:22:48","","","","","","arXiv:2010.08839 [hep-th]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1823765","arXiv.org","","6 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 5 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) ZSCC: NoCitationData[s0]  arXiv:2010.08839 [hep-th] Citation Key: Jakobsen:2020diz","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/N2QSBPMS/Jakobsen2020diz.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology; High Energy Physics - Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The focus is on topological insulators and topological semi-metals. The latter have a Fermi surface that is characterized as a topological defect. For topological insulators, the two alternative view points of twisted fiber bundles and of topological textures are developed. The minimal mathematical background in topology (essentially on homotopy groups and fiber bundles) is provided when needed. Topics rarely reviewed include: periodic versus canonical Bloch Hamiltonian (basis I/II issue), Zak versus Berry phase, the vanishing electric polarization of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and Dirac insulators.","2021","2020-12-24 07:40:17","2024-02-18 13:41:42","2020-12-24 07:40:16","034007","","","4","","Materials","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1837911","arXiv.org","","29 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 28 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) tex.ids= cayssol2021 arXiv:2012.11941 [cond-mat.mes-hall] Citation Key: Cayssol:2020wna","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/JTR9X6WZ/Cayssol2020wna.pdf","","Condensed Matter - Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics; To Read","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If both the bath and the probe are described by same microscopic Hamiltonian, thermalization further entails that the probe imbibes the phase of the bath. We refer to this phenomenon as phase thermalization. However, it is not clear whether this phenomenon is realizable when the probe and the bath are described by different microscopic Hamiltonians. We show phase thermalization is possible even when the microscopic Hamiltonians differ significantly. We provide an explicit example, where the probe is a Fermi liquid realized by a Majorana chain with $n \gg 1$ fermions per site interacting through random hopping and the bath is an incoherent metal described by another Majorana chain with $N > n$ fermions per site interacting through arbitrarily long range random four-fermion interaction.

The recovery of initial information embedded locally in the system from the scrambled quantum state is a fundamental concern in many contexts. From a dynamical perspective, information recovery can measure dynamical instability in quantum chaos, fault-tolerant quantum computing, and the black hole information paradox. This article considers general aspects of quantum information recovery when the scrambling dynamics have conservation laws due to Lie group symmetries. Here, we establish fundamental limitations on the information recovery from scrambling dynamics with arbitrary Lie group symmetries. We show universal relations between information recovery, symmetry, and quantum coherence, which apply to many physical situations. The relations predict that the behavior of the Hayden-Preskill black hole model changes qualitatively under the assumption of the energy conservation law. Consequently, we can rigorously prove that under the energy conservation law, the error of the information recovery from a small black hole remains unignorably large until it completely evaporates. Moreover, even when the black hole is very large, the recovery of information thrown into the black hole is not completed until most of the black hole evaporates. The relations also provide a unified view of the symmetry restrictions on quantum information processing, such as the approximate Eastin-Knill theorem and the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem for unitary gates.","2021-03-02","2021-03-03 12:53:11","2024-02-18 13:41:40","2021-03-03 12:53:11","","","","","","arXiv:2103.01876 [quant-ph]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1849646","arXiv.org","","25 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 18 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) arXiv:2103.01876 [quant-ph] Citation Key: Tajima:2021nwu","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/IDFDA2NV/Tajima2021nwu.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; Condensed Matter - Statistical Mechanics; Quantum Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even though such state has been successfully described within a phenomenological scheme, the so-called Marginal Fermi-Liquid theory, a microscopic explanation is still missing. However, recent resonant X-ray scattering experiments identified a new class of charge density fluctuations characterized by low characteristic energies and short correlation lengths, which are related to the well-known charge density waves. These fluctuations are present over a wide region of the temperature-vs-doping phase diagram and extend well above T*.

As an initial probe of our result, we show it compares very well with experimental data for the resistivity of LSCO at different values of the applied field. We also apply our result to Bi2201 and show that the magnetoresistivity in the strange metal phase of this material, exhibits the $H^2$ to $H$ crossover, as we move from the weak to the strong field regime. Yet, despite of that, the magnetoresistivity does not present a quadrature scaling. Remarkably, the resistivity H-field derivative does scale as a function of $\frac{H}{T}$, in complete agreement with recent magneto-transport measurements made in the strange metal phase of cuprates \cite{Hussey2020}. We, finally, address the issue of the $T$-power-law dependence of the resistivity of overdoped cuprates and compare our results with experimental data for Tl2201.

This textbook, developed from a graduate course Fradkin has taught for decades at the University of Illinois, offers a new, ""multicultural"" approach to the subject that seeks to remedy this fragmentation. It covers both basic techniques and topics at the frontiers of current research, and integrates modern concepts and examples from high-energy, statistical, and condensed-matter physics alike. Extensive problem sets further illustrate applications across a range of subfields. The book will be suitable for students across physical subdisciplines who have mastered graduate-level quantum mechanics, and will be a useful reference for researchers""--","2021","2023-06-26 13:15:24","2023-10-09 07:39:55","","","1","","","","","Quantum field theory","","","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton","","","","","","Library of Congress ISBN","QC174.45","tex.ids= Fradkin2021-dl","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/F2G6DCBL/fradkin2021.pdf","","","⛔ No INSPIRE recid found; Quantum field theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Utilizing these findings, we establish lower bounds on the heating rate in two-tone protocols, such as those employed in topological frequency converters.

Much attention has been paid to Hecke and Birman-Murakami-Wenzl (BMW) R-matrices and related quantum matrix algebras. Trigonometric solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation associated with the quantum groups GL_q(N), SO_q(N), Sp_q(2n) and supergroups GL_q(N|M), Osp_q(N|2m), as well as their rational (Yangian) limits, are presented. Rational R-matrices for exceptional Lie algebras and elliptic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation are also considered. The basic concepts of the group algebra of the braid group and its finite dimensional quotients (such as Hecke and BMW algebras) are outlined. A sketch of the representation theories of the Hecke and BMW algebras is given (including methods for finding idempotents and their quantum dimensions).

Previous examinations of entanglement and holography have focused on specific classes of quantum systems due to the lack of computational techniques in field theory and the inherent limitation of holography. This dissertation informs various methods and formalisms to overcome these difficulties by extending the target quantum systems with mass and interactions, boundaries, and geometric variational ansatze. These approaches provide insights into the generalization of holography from the bottom up. This dissertation initiates a comprehensive study beyond conventional holography by establishing new techniques in quantum field theory, holography, and tensor networks. Focusing on entanglement entropy, we found it is generally expressed in terms of renormalized two-point correlators of both fundamental and composite operators. Beyond entanglement entropy, we found the operational meaning of the entanglement structure in generic tensor networks.

We propose two separate Goldstone boson equivalence theorems for the boundary and bulk degrees of freedom. We compute the holographic self-energy of the gauge field and show that its spectrum is either a continuum, gapped continuum, or a discretuum as a function of the Higgs bulk mass. When the Higgs has no bulk mass, the AdS isometries are unbroken. We find in that case that the dual CFT has a non-conserved U(1) current whose anomalous dimension is proportional to the square of the Higgs vacuum expectation value. When the Higgs background weakly breaks the AdS isometries, we present an adapted WKB method to solve the gauge field equations.

In this paper, we compute the renormalized viscosities, mode-to-mode energy transfers, energy fluxes, and shell-to-shell energy transfers for the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic turbulence (HDT) using field-theoretic methods. We employ Craya-Herring basis that provides separate renormalized viscosities and energy transfers for its two components. In addition, Craya-Herring basis eliminates complex tensor algebra and simplifies the calculations considerably. In the $k^{-5/3}$ spectral regime of 2D HDT, the energy transfers between neighbouring (local) wavenumbers are forward, but they are backwards for distant (nonlocal) wavenumbers. The individual transfers between the distant wavenumber shells are small, but their cumulative sum is significant and it overcomes the forward local transfer to yield a constant inverse energy cascade. For 3D HDT, the mode-to-mode and shell-to-shell energy transfers reveal forward energy transfers for both local and nonlocal wavenumbers. More importantly, using scale-by-scale energy transfers we show that the cumulative nonlocal and local energy transfers are of the same order, which is contrary to the assumption of local energy transfers in turbulence. For 3D HDT, the renormalized viscosity, $\nu_2(k)$, computed by us and other authors are in general agreement, and it varies as $k^{-4/3}$. For 2D HDT, our the renormalized viscosity, $\nu_1(k)>0$, but $\nu_1(k)$ reported in literature shows significant variations including a negative $\nu_1(k)$. In this paper, we argue that the inconsistencies in $\nu_1(k)$ indicate inadequacy of renormalization group analysis that takes into account only local interactions and excludes nonlocal ones. In 2D HDT, the opposing nature of local and nonlocal energy transfers amplifies the error in $\nu_1(k)$.","2023-07-19","2023-10-02 14:38:51","2023-10-09 07:39:27","2023-10-02 14:38:51","","","","","","arXiv:2309.05207 [physics.flu-dyn]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2696144","arXiv.org","","0 citations (INSPIRE 2023/10/2) 0 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2023/10/2) arXiv:2309.05207 [physics.flu-dyn] Citation Key: Verma:2023qcx","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/UNPT6JT6/Verma2023qcx.pdf","","","Condensed Matter - Statistical Mechanics; High Energy Physics - Theory; Nonlinear Sciences - Chaotic Dynamics; Physics - Fluid Dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Subsequently, we write a generating function from which the complex metric, as well as higher order geometric tensors (affine connection, Riemann curvature tensor) can be obtained in terms of gauge invariant cumulants. The generating function explicitly relates the quantities which characterize the geometry of the parameter space to quantum fluctuations. We also show that for a mixed quantum-classical system both real and imaginary parts of the quantum metric contribute to the dynamics, if the mass tensor is Hermitian. A many operator generalization of the uncertainty principle results from taking the determinant of the complex quantum metric. We also calculate the quantum metric for a number of Lie group coherent states, including several representations of the $SU(1,1)$ group. In our examples non-trivial complex geometry results for generalized coherent states. A pair of oscillator states corresponding to the $SU(1,1)$ group gives a double series for its spectrum.

In particular, we study the density fluctuations and the distribution of the area surrounding each pairon on the scale of the antiferromagnetic correlation length $\xi_{AF}$, for the complete range of hole concentration. We show that the key parameters of the phase diagram, the $T_c$ dome, and the pseudogap temperature $T^*$, emerge from the statistical properties of the pairon disordered state. In this approach, the superconducting and the pseudogap states appear as inseparable phenomena. The condensation energy, which fixes the critical temperature, is directly proportional to the {\it correlation energy} between pairons and {\it not} to the energy gap, contrary to conventional superconductors. When the correlation energy between pairons is suppressed by fluctuations, either thermally, by disorder, or in the vortex core, the pseudogap state of disordered pairons is obtained. We attribute the unique features of cuprate superconductivity to this order-disorder transition in real space, which clearly differs from the BCS mechanism.

All physical observables relax at the same rate which scales with the final temperature through an exponent that depends universally on the low energy spectrum of the system and the bath.

Here we show that in the limit of weak explicit breaking, locality of hydrodynamics implies that the damping of pseudo-Goldstones is completely determined by their mass and diffusive transport coefficients. We present many applications: superfluids, QCD in the chiral limit, Wigner crystal and density wave phases in the presence of an external magnetic field or not, nematic phases and (anti-)ferromagnets. For electronic density wave phases, pseudo-Goldstone damping generates a contribution to the resistivity independent of the strength of disorder, which can have a linear temperature dependence provided the associated diffusivity saturates a bound.

This includes momentum relaxation times previously derived by the memory matrix formalism, and non-perturbative holographic results; in the latter case, this is subject to some important subtleties.

The identification of a universal velocity scale, independent of the presence of well-defined quasiparticle excitations, is one of the major challenges of this program. A recent analysis, valid for emergent IR fixed points exhibiting local quantum criticality, and dual to IR AdS$_2$ geometries, suggests to identify such a velocity using the time and length scales at which hydrodynamics breaks down -- the equilibration velocity. The latter relates to the radius of convergence of the hydrodynamic expansion and it is extracted from a collision between a hydrodynamic diffusive mode and a non-hydrodynamic mode associated to the IR AdS$_2$ region. In this short note, we confirm this picture for holographic systems displaying the spontaneous breaking of translational invariance. Moreover, we find that, at zero temperature, the lower bound set by quantum chaos and the upper one defined by causality and hydrodynamics exactly coincide, determining uniquely the diffusion constant.

The information recovered from the shock wave can be reconstructed in terms of purely diffusion-like, linearized gravitational waves at the horizon of a single-sided black hole with specific regularity-enforced imaginary values of frequency and momentum. In two-derivative bulk theories, this horizon ""diffusion"" can be related to late-time momentum diffusion via a simple relation, which ceases to hold in higher-derivative theories. We then show that the same values of imaginary frequency and momentum follow from a dispersion relation of a hydrodynamic sound mode. The frequency, momentum and group velocity give the holographic Lyapunov exponent and the butterfly velocity. Moreover, at this special point along the sound dispersion relation curve, the residue of the retarded longitudinal stress-energy tensor two-point function vanishes. This establishes a direct link between a hydrodynamic sound mode at an analytically continued, imaginary momentum and the holographic butterfly effect.

Axion-dilaton model is particularly interesting since it shows linear-$T$-resistivity, which may have something to do with the universal bound of diffusion. At finite density, there are two diffusion constants $D_\pm$ describing the coupled diffusion of charge and energy. By computing $D_\pm$ exactly, we find that in the incoherent regime ($\beta/T \gg 1,\ \beta/\mu \gg 1$) $D_+$ is identified with the charge diffusion constant ($D_c$) and $D_-$ is identified with the energy diffusion constant ($D_e$). In the coherent regime, at very small density, $D_\pm$ are `maximally' mixed in the sense that $D_+(D_-)$ is identified with $D_e(D_c)$, which is opposite to the case in the incoherent regime. In the incoherent regime $D_e \sim C_- \hbar v_B^2 / k_B T$ where $C_- = 1/2$ or 1 so it is universal independently of $\beta$ and $\mu$. However, $D_c \sim C_+ \hbar v_B^2 / k_B T$ where $C_+ = 1$ or $ \beta^2/16\pi^2 T^2$ so, in general, $C_+$ may not saturate to the lower bound in the incoherent regime, which suggests that the characteristic velocity for charge diffusion may not be the butterfly velocity.

In the case of doubletrace deformations, and for bulk scalars with masses in the range $-d^2/4<m^2<-d^2/4+1$, the deformed theory flows between two fixed points of the renormalization group, manifesting a resonant behavior at the scale characterizing the transition between the two CFT's.

At the same time, the optical conductivity ceases to be of Drude form at high temperatures, suggesting a change of the underlying dynamics that surprisingly leaves the $T$-linear DC-resistivity unaffected. We use the AdS/CFT correspondence that describes strongly coupled, densely entangled metals to study DC thermo-electrical transport and the optical conductivities of the local quantum critical Gubser-Rocha holographic strange metal in the presence of a lattice potential, a prime candidate to compare with experiment. We find that the DC-resistivity is linear in $T$ at low temperatures for a range of lattice strengths and wavevectors, even as it transitions between different dissipative regimes. At weak lattice potential the optical conductivity evolves with increasing temperature from a Drude form to a bad-metal characterized by a mid-IR resonance without changing the DC transport, similar to that seen in cuprate strange metals. This mid-IR peak and its temperature evolution can be understood as a consequence of Umklapp hydrodynamics: hydrodynamic perturbations are Bloch modes in the presence of a lattice. At strong lattice potential an incoherent metal is realized instead where momentum conservation no longer plays a role in transport. In this regime the thermal diffusivity can be explained by Planckian dissipation originating in universal microscopic chaos, similar to holographic metals with strong homogeneous momentum relaxation. The charge diffusivity does not submit to this chaos explanation, even though the continuing linear-in-$T$ DC resistivity saturates to an apparent universal slope, numerically equal to a Planckian rate.","2023-09-15","2022-12-09 16:25:04","2023-09-29 08:20:27","2022-12-09 16:25:04","125145","","12","108","","Phys.

It is dual to a local quantum critical phase instead of a quantum critical point. This result follows from a detailed analysis of the possible quantizations of the gravitational theory that is consistent with the thermodynamics of the analytical Gubser-Rocha black hole solution. The analytic Gubser-Rocha black hole is only a 2-parameter subset of all possible solutions, and we construct other members numerically. These new numerical solutions correspond to turning on an additional scalar charge. Moreover, each solution has multiple holographic interpretations depending on the quantization chosen. In one particular quantization involving a multitrace deformation the scalar charge is a marginal operator.

We found a possibility that conventional calculations may not explain the experimental results. This paper proposes a basic method for understanding stationary particle production on manifolds by means of the Stokes phenomenon. To address the problem of the vacuum definition and stationary particle production, we show how to understand the ``vacuum'' of the Schwinger effect. The Stokes phenomenon in the Unruh effect is then discussed and the differences to the Schwinger effect are explained. Normally, when calculating the Bogoliubov transformation of the Unruh effect, it is derived from the consistency of the whole space. However, if the constant acceleration is a temporal approximation, this extrapolation may incorrectly imply distant correlations that do not originally exist. To answer this question, one has to derive an explicit local Unruh effect. We have identified the Stokes phenomenon of the Unruh effect and calculated the Bogoliubov transformation in local. Our result (the Unruh temperature) differs from conventional calculations by a factor of 2, which seems to be suggesting the absence of the distant correlation. This will be tested by experimentation because this factor appears in the Unruh temperature. Then, we show that the Schwinger and the Unruh effects should occur simultaneously under a strong electric field, which can be verified experimentally as an enhancement of the Schwinger effect. Identifying the Stokes phenomena of particle production and discriminating between similar phenomena will allow us to clearly understand the origin of the phenomena. We hope that such analytical methods will help to unravel many mysteries of physics.","2023-03-20","2023-03-23 09:49:40","2024-02-18 13:41:01","2023-03-23 09:49:40","","","","","","arXiv:2303.11521 [hep-th]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2644542","arXiv.org","","1 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 0 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) arXiv:2303.11521 [hep-th] Citation Key: Matsuda:2023mzr","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/VCI3LITB/Matsuda2023mzr.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology; High Energy Physics - Phenomenology; High Energy Physics - Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We develop a form factor expansion to compute such correlation functions and we show that, while the dynamics at the Euler scale is completely determined by the density of single quasiparticle excitations on top of the local steady state, diffusion is due to scattering processes among quasiparticles, which are only present in truly interacting systems.

Similarly to the instability properties of hydrodynamic open flows, it is shown that $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking can be either absolute or convective. In the former case, an initially-localized wave packet shows a secular growth with time at any given spatial position, whereas in the latter case the growth is observed in a reference frame moving at some drift velocity while decay occurs at any fixed spatial position. In the convective unstable regime, $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is restored when the spatial region of gain/loss in the lattice is limited (rather than extended). We consider specifically a non-Hermitian extension of the Rice-Mele tight binding lattice model, and show the existence of a transition from absolute to convective symmetry breaking when the advective term is large enough. An extension of the analysis to ac-dc-driven lattices is also presented, and an optical implementation of the non-Hermitian Rice-Mele model is suggested, which is based on light transport in an array of evanescently-coupled optical waveguides with a periodically-bent axis and alternating regions of optical gain and loss.","2013-11-06","2023-03-31 13:42:30","2024-02-18 13:42:32","2023-03-31 13:42:30","052102","","5","88","","Phys.

In particular, the existence of real eigenvalues of non-Hermitian systems has opened a wide set of possibilities, especially, but not only, for sensing applications, exploiting the physics of exceptional points. In particular, the square root dependence of the eigenvalue splitting on different design parameters, exhibited by 2 × 2 non-Hermitian Hamiltonian matrices at the exceptional point, paved the way to the integration of high-performance sensors. The square root dependence of the eigenfrequencies on the design parameters is the reason for a theoretically infinite sensitivity in the proximity of the exceptional point. Recently, higher-order exceptional points have demonstrated the possibility of achieving the nth root dependence of the eigenfrequency splitting on perturbations. However, the exceptional sensitivity to external parameters is, at the same time, the major drawback of non-Hermitian configurations, leading to the high influence of noise. In this review, the basic principles of PT-symmetric and anti-PT-symmetric Hamiltonians will be shown, both in photonics and in electronics. The influence of noise on non-Hermitian configurations will be investigated and the newest solutions to overcome these problems will be illustrated.

It stems from the inability to unambiguously impose ingoing boundary conditions at the horizon at an infinite discrete set of Fourier modes. The phenomenon has been best understood, when such a description exists, in terms of dual holographic (AdS/CFT) correlation function that take the value of `$0/0$' at these special points. In this work, we investigate details of pole-skipping purely from the point of view of classical gravity in 4$d$ massive black hole geometries with flat, spherical and hyperbolic horizons, and with an arbitrary cosmological constant. We show that pole-skipping points naturally fall into two categories: the algebraically special points and a set of pole-skipping points that is common to the even and odd channels of perturbations. Our analysis utilises and generalises (to arbitrary maximally symmetric horizon topology and cosmological constant) the `integrable' structure of the Darboux transformations, which relate the master field equations that describe the evolution of gravitational perturbations in the two channels. Finally, we provide new insights into a number of special cases: spherical black holes, asymptotically Anti-de Sitter black branes and pole-skipping at the cosmological horizon in de Sitter space.","2023-03-28","2023-04-11 09:35:15","2024-02-18 13:41:00","2023-04-11 09:35:15","","","","","","arXiv:2303.15921 [hep-th]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2646510","arXiv.org","","13 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 12 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) arXiv:2303.15921 [hep-th] Citation Key: Grozdanov:2023txs","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/962HWLXB/Grozdanov2023txs.pdf","","","⛔ No DOI found; General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology; High Energy Physics - Theory; Mathematical Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The only flow away from the HK model is through the superconducting channel which lifts the spin degeneracy as does any ordering tendency. The superconducting instability is identical to that established previously\cite{nat1}. A corollary of this work is that Hubbard repulsive interactions flow into the HK stable fixed point in the vicinity of half-filling. Consequently, although the HK model has all-to-all interactions, nothing local destroys it. The consilience with Hubbard arises because both models break the $Z_2$ symmetry on a Fermi surface, the HK model being the simplest to do so.

On the other hand, in a holographic many body system, the chaotic modes might be only associated with the energy conservation. This suggests that, perhaps, one can detect microscopic anomalies through the diagnosis of quantum chaos in such systems. To investigate this idea, we consider a magnetized brane in AdS space time with a Chern-Simons coupling in the bulk. By studying the shock wave geometry in this background, we first compute the corresponding butterfly velocities, in the presence of an external magnetic field $B$, in $\mu\ll T$ and $ B \ll T^2$ limit. We find that the butterfly propagation in the direction of $B$ has a different velocity than in the opposite direction. The splitting of butterfly velocities confirms the idea that chiral anomaly can be macroscopically manifested via quantum chaos. We then show that the pole-skipping points of energy density Green's function of the boundary theory coincide precisely with the chaos points. This might be regarded as the hydrodynamic origin of quantum chaos in an anomalous system. Additionally, by studying the near horizon dynamics of a scalar field on the above background, we find the spectrum of pole-skipping points associated with the two-point function of dual boundary operator. We find that the sum of wavenumbers corresponding to pole-skipping points at a specific Matsubara frequency is a universal quantity, which is independent of the scaling dimension of the dual boundary operator. We then show that this quantity follows from a closed formula and can be regarded as another macroscopic manifestation of the chiral anomaly.","2020-03-10","2023-05-03 08:13:23","2024-02-18 13:41:50","2023-05-03 08:13:23","050","","3","03","","JHEP","","","","","","","","en","","","INSPIRE","1762239","DOI.org (Crossref)","","29 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 25 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) arXiv:1910.13696 [hep-th] Citation Key: Abbasi:2019rhy","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/MQXUKQ34/Abbasi2019rhy.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this purpose, we apply the conjectured upper bound proposal related to the equilibration scales ($\omega_{\text{eq}}, k_{\text{eq}}$) to the Einstein-Maxwell-Axion model. ($\omega_{\text{eq}}, k_{\text{eq}}$) is defined as the collision point between the diffusive hydrodynamic mode and the first non-hydrodynamic mode, giving rise to the upper bound of the diffusion constant $D$ at low temperature $T$ as $D = \omega_{\text{eq}}/k_{\text{eq}}^2$. We show that the upper bound proposal also works for the charge diffusion and ($\omega_{\text{eq}}, k_{\text{eq}}$), at low $T$, is determined by $D$ and the scaling dimension $\Delta(0)$ of an infra-red operator as $(\omega_{\text{eq}}, \, k_{\text{eq}}^2) \,=\, (2 \pi T \Delta(0) \,, \omega_{\text{eq}}/D)$, as for other diffusion constants. However, for the charge diffusion, we find that the collision occurs at real $k_{\text{eq}}$, while it is complex for other diffusions. In order to examine the universality of the conjectured upper bound, we also introduce a higher derivative coupling to the Einstein-Maxwell-Axion model. This coupling is particularly interesting since it leads to the violation of the \textit{lower} bound of the charge diffusion constant so the correction may also have effects on the \textit{upper} bound of the charge diffusion.

The modern numerical bootstrap method has seen its greatest success in the fields of conformal field theory (via the conformal bootstrap) and Scattering amplitude (through the S-matrix bootstrap).

From a boundary perspective these `pole-skipping' points correspond to locations in the complex frequency and momentum planes at which a line of poles of the retarded Green's function intersects with a line of zeroes. As a consequence the dispersion relations of collective modes in the boundary theory at energy scales $\omega\sim T$ are directly constrained by the bulk dynamics near the black-brane horizon. For the case of conserved $U(1)$ current and energy-momentum tensor operators we give examples where the dispersion relations of hydrodynamic modes pass through a succession of pole-skipping points as real wavenumber is increased.

So far the chaotic behavior has been obtained through explicit calculations in specific models. In this paper we propose a unified description of the exponential growth and ballistic butterfly spreading of OTOCs across different systems using a newly formulated ""quantum hydrodynamics,"" which is valid at finite $\hbar$ and to all orders in derivatives. The scrambling of a generic few-body operator in a chaotic system is described as building up a ""hydrodynamic cloud,"" and the exponential growth of the cloud arises from a shift symmetry of the hydrodynamic action. The shift symmetry also shields correlation functions of the energy density and flux, and time ordered correlation functions of generic operators from exponential growth, while leads to chaotic behavior in OTOCs. The theory also predicts an interesting phenomenon of the skipping of a pole at special values of complex frequency and momentum in two-point functions of energy density and flux. This pole-skipping phenomenon may be considered as a ""smoking gun"" for the hydrodynamic origin of the chaotic mode. We also discuss the possibility that such a hydrodynamic description could be a hallmark of maximally chaotic systems.","2018-10-19","2023-04-22 09:37:06","2024-02-18 13:42:07","2023-04-22 09:37:06","127","","10","10","","JHEP","","","","","","","","en","","","INSPIRE","1645670","DOI.org (Crossref)","","141 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 128 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: Blake:2017ris arXiv: 1801.00010 [hep-th]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/9ICH69SN/Blake2017ris.pdf","","","chaos; cloud; correlation function: thermal; Effective Field Theories; energy: correlation function; energy: density; Gauge-gravity correspondence; hydrodynamics; many-body problem; Quantum Dissipative Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An important question is to understand what is special about maximally chaotic systems which saturate this bound. Here we provide further evidence for the `hydrodynamic' origin of chaos in such systems, and discuss hallmarks of maximally chaotic systems. We first provide evidence that a hydrodynamic effective field theory of chaos we previously proposed should be understood as a theory of maximally chaotic systems. We then emphasize and make explicit a signature of maximal chaos which was only implicit in prior literature, namely the suppression of exponential growth in commutator squares of generic few-body operators. We provide a general argument for this suppression within our chaos effective field theory, and illustrate it using SYK models and holographic systems. We speculate that this suppression indicates that the nature of operator scrambling in maximally chaotic systems is fundamentally different to scrambling in non-maximally chaotic systems.

Here the intrinsic correlation between the strength of the low-temperature linear-in-temperature normal-state resistivity and superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ in the overdoped electron-doped cuprate superconductors is studied within the framework of the kinetic-energy-driven superconductivity. On the one hand, the main ingredient is identified into a electron pairing mechanism involving {\it the spin excitation}, and then $T_{\rm c}$ has a dome-like shape doping dependence with the maximal $T_{\rm c}$ that occurs at around the optimal electron doping. On the other hand, in the normal-state above $T_{\rm c}$, the low-temperature linear-in-temperature normal-state resistivity in the overdoped regime arises from the momentum relaxation due to the electron umklapp scattering mediated by {\it the same spin excitation}. This {\it same spin excitation} that governs both the electron umklapp scattering responsible for the low-temperature linear-in-temperature normal-state resistivity and electron pairing responsible for superconductivity naturally generates a correlation between the strength of the low-temperature linear-in-temperature normal-state resistivity and $T_{\rm c}$ in the overdoped regime.","2023-10-18","2023-10-20 07:38:31","2023-12-23 15:13:02","2023-10-20 07:38:31","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2310.12414 [cond-mat]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/QXE3Q8A5/ma2023a.pdf","","","⛔ No INSPIRE recid found; Condensed Matter - Strongly Correlated Electrons; Condensed Matter - Superconductivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2310.12414","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When this behaviour is investigated by probing the scattering rate of strongly interacting electrons in metals, it is clear that in some cases only electron-electron scattering can be its cause, while in others it arises from high-temperature scattering of electrons from quantised lattice vibrations, i.e. phonons. In metallic oxides, which are among the most studied materials, analysis of electrical transport does not satisfactorily identify the relevant scattering mechanism at 'high' temperatures near room temperature. We employ a contactless optical method to measure thermal diffusivity in two Ru-based layered perovskites, Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ and Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, and use the measurements to extract the dimensionless Lorenz ratio. By comparing our results to the literature data on both conventional and unconventional metals we show how the analysis of high-temperature thermal transport can both give important insight into dominant scattering mechanisms, and be offered as a stringent test of theories attempting to explain anomalous scattering.","2023-10-18","2023-10-19 08:01:56","2023-12-23 15:13:01","2023-10-19 08:01:56","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2310.11796 [cond-mat]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/KTL5ATTM/sun2023.pdf","","","⛔ No INSPIRE recid found; Condensed Matter - Strongly Correlated Electrons","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2310.11796","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The difference between the TEE and the value predicted by the anyon theory is often called the spurious topological entanglement entropy.

This framework separates the topological data from the local dynamics of a theory and provides a unified description of the symmetry and duality in gapped and gapless phases of matter. In this work, we develop the topological holographic picture for (1+1)d quantum phases, including both gapped phases as well as a wide range of quantum critical points, including phase transitions between symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, symmetry enriched quantum critical points, deconfined quantum critical points and intrinsically gapless SPT phases. Topological holography puts a strong constraint on the emergent symmetry and the anomaly for these critical theories. We show how the partition functions of these critical points can be obtained from dualizing (orbifolding) more familiar critical theories. The topological responses of the defect operators are also discussed in this framework. We further develop a topological holographic picture for conformal boundary states of (1+1)d rational conformal field theories.

We study the thermodynamics of this model both analytically and numerically, exposing the presence of algebraically decaying correlations and demonstrating an extensive ground state entropy, and give a comprehensive account of its ground state properties and excitations. Each classical ground state may be decomposed into collections of closed 2-dimensional membranes, supporting fractionalized string excitations attached to the boundaries of open membranes. At finite temperature, the model can then be described as a gas of closed strings in a background of fluctuating membranes. We demonstrate that the emergent gauge structure of the low-temperature phase is naturally captured in the formalism of 2-form electrodynamics, which describes 1-dimensional charged strings coupled to a rank-2 anti-symmetric gauge field. After establishing the classical spin vorticity model, we consider perturbing it with quantum exchange interactions, from which we derive an effective membrane exchange model of the quantum dynamics of these membranes, which maps to a frustrated 2-form U(1) lattice gauge theory. We show the existence of a fine-tuned Rokhsar-Kivelson point where the quantum ground state is an equal weight superposition of all classical ground state configurations. We further demonstrate how to quantize the string excitations, by coupling a 1-form string field to the emergent 2-form U(1) gauge field, thus mapping a quantum spin model to a 2-form gauge-Higgs model.

At late interior times the equations are identical to those analyzed in depth by Misner and by Belinskii-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz fifty years ago. We review and extend known classical and semiclassical results on the interior chaos, formulated as both a dynamical system of `Kasner eras' and as a hyperbolic billiards problem. The volume of the universe collapses doubly-exponentially over each Kasner era. A remarkable feature is the emergence of a conserved energy, and hence a `time-independent' Hamiltonian, at asymptotically late interior times. A quantisation of this Hamiltonian exhibits arithmetic chaos associated with the principal congruence subgroup $\Gamma(2)$ of the modular group.

With the assumption of self-averaging randomness, similar to that in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, numerous observed properties of a strange metal were obtained for wide range of intermediate temperatures, including the linear-in-temperature resistivity. The Harris criterion implies that spatial fluctuations in the local position of the critical point must dominate at low temperatures, and these were not fully accounted for in the recent theory. We use multiple graphics processing units to compute the real frequency spectrum of the scalar propagator in several random realizations, assuming Landau-damping from the fermions, and a spatially random mass. We find behavior consistent with the emergence of the physics of the random transverse-field Ising model, as has been proposed by Hoyos, Kotabage, and Vojta. This emergent low temperature regime, controlled by localized overdamped eigenmodes of the scalar field, also has a resistivity which is nearly linear-in-temperature, and extends into a `quantum critical phase' away from the quantum critical point, as observed in several cuprates.","2023-12-11","2023-12-13 12:08:35","2023-12-13 13:11:54","2023-12-13 12:08:35","","","","","","arXiv:2312.06751 [cond-mat.str-el]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2735984","arXiv.org","","0 citations (INSPIRE 2023/12/13) 0 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2023/12/13) arXiv:2312.06751 [cond-mat.str-el] Citation Key: Patel:2023fuu","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/F3YVUQME/Patel2023fuu.pdf","","⭐️","Condensed Matter - Disordered Systems and Neural Networks; Condensed Matter - Strongly Correlated Electrons","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We first compute hydrodynamic correlation functions in the linear response regime. Then we use the linear response results to explore the analytical structure of response functions beyond the linear response. A method is developed to numerically calculate the branch cut structure from the well-known Landau equations. We apply our method to the shear channel and find the branch cuts of a certain response function, without computing the response function itself. We then solve the Landau equations analytically and find the threshold singularities of the same response function. Using these results, we achieve the leading singularity in momentum space, by which, we find the long-time tail of the correlation function.

We show that a certain class of gapless fractonic phases are realized as a result of spontaneous breaking of continuous higher-form symmetries whose conserved charges do not commute with spatial translations. We refer to such symmetries as nonuniform higher-form symmetries. These symmetries fall within the standard definition of higher-form symmetries in quantum field theory, and the corresponding symmetry generators are topological. Worldlines of particles are regarded as the charged objects of 1-form symmetries, and mobility restrictions can be implemented by introducing additional 1-form symmetries whose generators do not commute with spatial translations. These features are realized by effective field theories associated with spontaneously broken nonuniform 1-form symmetries. At low energies, the theories reduce to known higher-rank gauge theories such as scalar/vector charge gauge theories, and the gapless excitations in these theories are interpreted as Nambu--Goldstone modes for higher-form symmetries. Due to the nonuniformity of the symmetry, some of the modes acquire a gap, which is the higher-form analogue of the inverse Higgs mechanism of spacetime symmetries. The gauge theories have emergent nonuniform magnetic symmetries, and some of the magnetic monopoles become fractonic. We identify the 't~Hooft anomalies of the nonuniform higher-form symmetries and the corresponding bulk symmetry-protected topological phases. By this method, the mobility restrictions are fully determined by the choice of the commutation relations of charges with translations. This approach allows us to view existing (gapless) fracton models such as the scalar/vector charge gauge theories and their variants from a unified perspective and enables us to engineer theories with desired mobility restrictions.","2023-11-24","2023-11-28 13:52:22","2024-02-18 13:40:24","2023-11-28 13:52:22","","","","","","arXiv:2207.00854 [cond-mat.str-el]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2105373","arXiv.org","","9 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 9 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) arXiv:2207.00854 [cond-mat.str-el] Citation Key: Hirono:2022dci","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/LR6DLNLG/Hirono2022dci.pdf","","","Condensed Matter - Strongly Correlated Electrons; High Energy Physics - Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our approach considers the time evolution in the Lanczos basis, which maps the system's dynamics onto that of a particle moving in a one-dimensional lattice where both the energy in the lattice sites and the tunneling from one lattice site to the next are inhomogeneous. We infer a criterion that allows distinguishing localized from chaotic systems. This criterion involves the coupling strengths between Lanczos states and their expectation energy fluctuations. We verify its validity by inspecting three cases, corresponding to Anderson localization as a function of dimension, the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a many-body dipolar spin system, and integrable systems. We finally show that our approach provides a justification for the Wigner surmise and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which have both been proposed to characterize quantum chaotic systems. Indeed, our criterion for a system to be chaotic implies the level repulsion (also known as spectral rigidity) of eigenenergies, which is characteristic of the Wigner-Dyson distribution; and we also demonstrate that in the chaotic regime, the expectation value of any local observable only weakly varies as a function of eigenstates. Our demonstration allows to define the class of operators to which the eigenstate thermalization applies, as the ones that connect states that are coupled at weak order by the Hamiltonian.","2023-11-24","2023-11-28 13:49:07","2023-11-28 13:49:14","2023-11-28 13:49:07","","","","","","arXiv:2307.10706 [quant-ph]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2678889","arXiv.org","","0 citations (INSPIRE 2023/11/28) 0 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2023/11/28) arXiv:2307.10706 [quant-ph] Citation Key: Alaoui:2023cdo","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/4USSGFHI/Alaoui2023cdo.pdf","","⭐️","Condensed Matter - Quantum Gases; Quantum Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The scheme is based on the generalised harmonic formulation of the Einstein equations. The main difficulty in removing all symmetry assumptions can be phrased in terms of finding a set of generalised harmonic source functions that are consistent with the AdS boundary conditions. I detail a prescription to obtain the set of source functions that achieves stable evolution in full generality. This prescription leads to the first long-time stable 3+1 simulations of four dimensional spacetimes with a negative cosmological constant in Cartesian coordinates. I show results of gravitational collapse with no symmetry assumptions, and the subsequent ringdown to a static black hole in the bulk, which corresponds to evolution towards a homogeneous state on the boundary. Furthermore, it is argued that this scheme is well-suited for the study of black hole superradiance -- the amplification of waves scattering off a rotating black hole -- in Kerr-AdS spacetime. This statement is supported by the results of a preliminary simulation of perturbed Kerr-AdS.","2023-11-23","2023-11-28 13:38:03","2024-02-18 13:40:31","2023-11-28 13:38:03","","","","","","arXiv:2205.15329 [gr-qc]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2089857","arXiv.org","","1 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 0 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) arXiv:2205.15329 [gr-qc] Citation Key: Rossi:2022nao","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/BU667SVW/Rossi2022nao.pdf","","","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology; High Energy Physics - Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This bath models a laboratory and is described by a quantum field theory. In the dual conformal field theory (CFT) description this coupling is achieved by a double-trace deformation that couples the CFT with the bath. This suggests that the physics observed by the laboratory is fully unitary.

The flows are obtained by deforming a holographic conformal field theory with a relevant operator, altering the interior geometry from AdS-Schwarzschild to a more general Kasner universe near the spacelike singularity. We introduce null matter in the form of a shock wave into this geometry and scrutinize its impact on the near-horizon and interior dynamics of the black hole. Using out-of-time-order correlators, we find that the scrambling time increases as we increase the strength of the deformation, whereas the butterfly velocity displays a non-monotonic behavior. We examine other observables that are more sensitive to the black hole interior, such as the thermal $a$-function and the entanglement velocity. Notably, the $a$-function experiences a discontinuous jump across the shock wave, signaling an instantaneous loss of degrees of freedom due to the infalling matter. This jump is interpreted as a `cosmological time skip' which arises from an infinitely boosted length contraction. The entanglement velocity exhibits similar dependence to the butterfly velocity as we vary the strength of the deformation. Lastly, we extend our analyses to a model where the interior geometry undergoes an infinite sequence of bouncing Kasner epochs.","2023-11-21","2023-11-24 10:08:17","2023-11-24 10:08:19","2023-11-24 10:08:17","","","","","","arXiv:2311.12940 [hep-th]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2725512","arXiv.org","","0 citations (INSPIRE 2023/11/24) 0 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2023/11/24) arXiv:2311.12940 [hep-th] Citation Key: Caceres:2023zft","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/WGYQM3EQ/Caceres2023zft.pdf","","","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology; High Energy Physics - Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we revisit the possibility of understanding strongly coupled metals through a holographic duality with a weakly coupled gravitational theory in one higher dimension (i.e. a suitable generalization of the ""AdS/CFT duality"". Previous attempts at devising holographic models of strongly coupled metals have suffered from severe drawbacks; for example, they do not even seem to be able to describe a Fermi surface that satisfies Luttinger's theorem, which is ought to be a core requirement in any physically reasonable model of a metal. Here, we propose a radically different approach to constructing holographic models of strongly coupled metals. The idea is that for applications, it should be sufficient to construct a holographic dual of the effective field theory that controls the infra-red physics of the metal.

In quantum gravity there are no global symmetries, so any spacetime inversion symmetries must be gauge symmetries. In particular this includes $\mathcal{CRT}$ symmetry (in even dimensions usually combined with a rotation to become $\mathcal{CPT}$), which in quantum field theory is always a symmetry and seems likely to be a symmetry of quantum gravity as well. In this article we discuss what it means to gauge a spacetime inversion symmetry, and we explain some of the more unusual consequences of doing this. In particular we argue that the gauging of $\mathcal{CRT}$ is automatically implemented by the sum over topologies in the Euclidean gravity path integral, that in a closed universe the Hilbert space of quantum gravity must be a real vector space, and that in Lorentzian signature manifolds which are not time-orientable must be included as valid configurations of the theory.

Some signatures of chaos, like the spectral form factor (SFF), take all the correlations into account, while others sample only short-range or long-range correlations. Here, we characterize correlations between eigenenergies at all possible spectral distances. Specifically, we study the distribution of $k$-th neighbor level spacings ($k$nLS) and compute its associated $k$-th neighbor spectral form factor ($k$nSFF). This leads to two new full-range signatures of quantum chaos, the variance of the $k$nLS distribution and the minimum value of the $k$nSFF, which quantitatively characterize correlations between pairs of eigenenergies with any number of levels $k$ between them. We find exact and approximate expressions for these signatures in the three Gaussian ensembles of random matrix theory (GOE, GUE and GSE) and in integrable systems with completely uncorrelated spectra (the Poisson ensemble). We illustrate our findings in a XXZ spin chain with disorder, which interpolates between chaotic and integrable behavior. Our refined measures of chaos allow us to probe deviations from Poissonian and Random Matrix behavior in realistic systems. This illustrates how the measures we introduce bring a new light into studying many-body quantum systems, which lie in-between the fully chaotic or fully integrable models.","2023-11-15","2023-11-19 15:53:39","2024-02-18 13:40:35","2023-11-19 15:53:39","","","","","","arXiv:2311.09292 [quant-ph]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2723181","arXiv.org","","2 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 1 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) arXiv:2311.09292 [quant-ph] Citation Key: Shir:2023olc","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/LVNGA3Z9/Shir et al. - 2023 - Full range spectral correlations and their spectra.pdf","","","Condensed Matter - Statistical Mechanics; High Energy Physics - Theory; Mathematical Physics; Nonlinear Sciences - Chaotic Dynamics; Quantum Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has previously been argued that an infinite-dimensional emergent symmetry group is such a property, at least for clean, compressible metals. In this paper, we will show that such an emergent symmetry group has very strong implications for the dynamics of the metal. Specifically, we show that consideration of the hydrodynamics of the associated infinitely many emergent conserved quantities automatically recovers the collisionless Boltzmann equation that governs the dynamics of a Fermi liquid. Therefore, the hydrodynamic prediction is that in the low-temperature, collisionless regime where the emergent conservation laws hold, the dynamics and response to external fields of a general spinless metal will be identical to a Fermi liquid. We discuss some potential limitations to this general statement, including the possibility of non-hydrodynamic modes.

We show that if $\nu$ is fractional (i.e. not an integer), this imposes very strong constraints on the low-energy theory of the system and give a framework to understand such constraints in great generality, vastly generalizing the Luttinger and Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems. The most powerful constraint comes about if $\nu$ is continuously tunable (i.e. the system is charge-compressible), in which case we show that the low-energy theory must have a very large emergent symmetry group -- larger than any compact Lie group. An example is the Fermi surface of a Fermi liquid, where the charge at every point on the Fermi surface is conserved. We expect that in many, if not all, cases, even exotic non-Fermi liquids will have the same emergent symmetry group as a Fermi liquid, even though they could have very different dynamics. We call a system with this property an ""ersatz Fermi liquid"". We show that ersatz Fermi liquids share a number of properties in common with Fermi liquids, including Luttinger's theorem (which is thus extended to a large class of non-Fermi liquids) and periodic ""quantum oscillations"" in the response to an applied magnetic field. We also establish versions of Luttinger's theorem for the composite Fermi liquid in quantum Hall systems and for spinon Fermi surfaces in Mott insulators.

It was previously studied as a model of a quantum spin glass, and while we find that the model is glassy for $q=2$, $q=3$, and likely $q=4$, we also find evidence for previously unexpected SYK-like behavior for the quenched free energy down to the lowest temperatures for $q \geq 5$. This SYK-like physics includes power-law correlation functions and an extensive low temperature entropy, so we refer to the model as Spin SYK. The model is generic in that it includes all possible $q$-body couplings, lacks most symmetries, and has no spatial structure, so our results can be construed as establishing a certain ubiquity of quantum holography in systems dominated by many-body interactions. Furthermore, we discuss a generalized family of models which includes Spin SYK and which provably exhibit SYK-like physics in the solvable limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. We also comment on implications of a bosonic system with SYK-like properties for the study of holography, Hamiltonian complexity, and related topics.","2023-11-02","2023-11-06 08:38:16","2024-02-18 13:40:38","2023-11-06 08:38:16","","","","","","arXiv:2311.01516 [hep-th]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","2718837","arXiv.org","","3 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 3 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) arXiv:2311.01516 [hep-th] Citation Key: Swingle:2023nvv","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/WKLB8825/Swingle2023nvv.pdf","","","Condensed Matter - Statistical Mechanics; Condensed Matter - Strongly Correlated Electrons; High Energy Physics - Theory; Quantum Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"3VWPD8EH","journalArticle","2023","Sá, Lucas","Signatures of dissipative quantum chaos","","","","10.48550/arXiv.2311.01518","http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01518","Understanding the far-from-equilibrium dynamics of dissipative quantum systems, where dissipation and decoherence coexist with unitary dynamics, is an enormous challenge with immense rewards. Often, the only realistic approach is to forgo a detailed microscopic description and search for signatures of universal behavior shared by collections of many distinct, yet sufficiently similar, complex systems. Quantum chaos provides a powerful statistical framework for addressing this question, relying on symmetries to obtain information not accessible otherwise. This thesis examines how to reconcile chaos with dissipation, proceeding along two complementary lines. In Part I, we apply non-Hermitian random matrix theory to open quantum systems with Markovian dissipation and discuss the relaxation timescales and steady states of three representative examples of increasing physical relevance: single-particle Lindbladians and Kraus maps, open free fermions, and dissipative Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. In Part II, we investigate the symmetries, correlations, and universality of many-body open quantum systems, classifying several models of dissipative quantum matter. From a theoretical viewpoint, this thesis lays out a generic framework for the study of the universal properties of realistic, chaotic, and dissipative quantum systems. From a practical viewpoint, it provides the concrete building blocks of dynamical dissipative evolution constrained by symmetry, with potential technological impact on the fabrication of complex quantum structures.
