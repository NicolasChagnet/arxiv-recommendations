2312.12349,Holographic complexity: braneworld gravity versus the Lloyd bound,Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez ; Ben Craps ; Juan Hernandez ; Mikhail Khramtsov ; Maria Knysh ; Ashish Shukla,hep-th,hep-th gr-qc,"We explore the complexity equals volume proposal for planar black holes in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime in 2+1 dimensions, with an end of the world (ETW) brane behind the horizon. We allow for the possibility of intrinsic gravitational dynamics in the form of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity to be localized on the brane. We compute the asymptotic rate of change of volume complexity analytically and obtain the full time dependence using numerical techniques. We find that the inclusion of JT gravity on the brane leads to interesting effects on time dependence of holographic complexity. We identify the region in parameter space (the brane location and the JT coupling) for which the rate of change of complexity violates the Lloyd bound. In an equivalent description of the model in terms of an asymptotically AdS wormhole, we connect the violation of the Lloyd bound to the violation of a suitable energy condition in the bulk that we introduce. We also compare the Lloyd bound constraints to previously derived constraints on the bulk parameters in this model that are based on bounds on entanglement growth in the dual CFT state.",2023-12-19 17:28:43+00:00,10.1007/JHEP03(2024)173

Aguilar-Gutierrez ; Andrew Rolph,hep-th,hep-th quant-ph,"We ask whether Krylov complexity is mutually compatible with the circuit and Nielsen definitions of complexity. We show that the Krylov complexities between three states fail to satisfy the triangle inequality and so cannot be a measure of distance: there is no possible metric for which Krylov complexity is the length of the shortest path to the target state or operator. We show this explicitly in the simplest example, a single qubit, and in general.",2023-11-07 16:04:10+00:00,10.48550/2311.04093

Vazquez-Mozo,hep-th,hep-th hep-ph nucl-th,"Nondissipative transport of strangeness is studied in a chiral hadronic plasma with three flavors. In the phase in which chiral symmetry is preserved, strangeness transport is found to be driven by both an external magnetic field and fluid vorticity. As for the constitutive relations of the baryon and electromagnetic currents, they exhibit vortical terms proportional to the strangeness chemical potential. In the superfluid phase, transverse nondissipative diffusion of the baryon, electromagnetic, and strangeness charges is found, which survives in the limit of vanishing chiral imbalance and mixes in a fashion similar to standard dissipative diffusion in quark-gluon plasma.",2023-10-24 14:24:14+00:00,10.1007/JHEP01(2024)174

Magan ; Qingyue Wu,hep-th,hep-th cond-mat.stat-mech nlin.CD quant-ph,"Quantum chaotic systems are conjectured to display a spectrum whose fine-grained features (gaps and correlations) are well described by Random Matrix Theory (RMT). We propose and develop a complementary version of this conjecture: quantum chaotic systems display a Lanczos spectrum whose local means and covariances are well described by RMT. To support this proposal, we first demonstrate its validity in examples of chaotic and integrable systems. We then show that for Haar-random initial states in RMTs the mean and covariance of the Lanczos spectrum suffices to produce the full long time behavior of general survival probabilities including the spectral form factor, as well as the spread complexity. In addition, for initial states with continuous overlap with energy eigenstates, we analytically find the long time averages of the probabilities of Krylov basis elements in terms of the mean Lanczos spectrum. This analysis suggests a notion of eigenstate complexity, the statistics of which differentiate integrable systems and classes of quantum chaos. Finally, we clarify the relation between spread complexity and the universality classes of RMT by exploring various values of the Dyson index and Poisson distributed spectra.",2023-12-06 19:02:22+00:00,10.48550/2312.03848

We provide a connection of this sort by constructing a specific matrix in terms of the eigenvectors of a given quantum Hamiltonian. The null eigenvalues of this matrix are in one-to-one correspondence with conserved quantities that have simple locality properties (a hallmark of integrability). The typical magnitude of the eigenvalues, on the other hand, controls an explicit bound on Nielsen's complexity of the quantum evolution operator, defined in terms of the same locality specifications. We demonstrate how this connection works in a few concrete examples of quantum spin chains that possess diverse arrays of highly structured conservation laws mandated by integrability.",2023-04-28 18:22:06+00:00,10.21468/SciPostPhys.16.2.041

Complexity is understood here as the shortest geodesic distance between the time-dependent evolution operator and the origin within the group of unitaries. (An appropriate `complexity metric' must be used that takes into account the relative difficulty of performing `nonlocal' operations that act on many degrees of freedom at once.) While simply formulated and geometrically attractive, this notion of complexity is numerically intractable save for toy models with Hilbert spaces of very low dimensions. To bypass this difficulty, we trade the exact definition in terms of geodesics for an upper bound on complexity, obtained by minimizing the distance over an explicitly prescribed infinite set of curves, rather than over all possible curves. Identifying this upper bound turns out equivalent to the closest vector problem (CVP) previously studied in integer optimization theory, in particular, in relation to lattice-based cryptography. Effective approximate algorithms are hence provided by the existing mathematical considerations, and they can be utilized in our analysis of the upper bounds on quantum evolution complexity. The resulting algorithmically implemented complexity bound systematically assigns lower values to integrable than to chaotic systems, as we demonstrate by explicit numerical work for Hilbert spaces of dimensions up to ~10^4.",2022-02-28 16:20:10+00:00,10.21468/SciPostPhys.13.4.090
2202.06957,Quantum chaos and the complexity of spread of states,Vijay Balasubramanian ; Pawel Caputa ; Javier Magan ; Qingyue Wu,hep-th,hep-th cond-mat.stat-mech quant-ph,"We propose a measure of quantum state complexity defined by minimizing the spread of the wave-function over all choices of basis. Our measure is controlled by the ""survival amplitude"" for a state to remain unchanged, and can be efficiently computed in theories with discrete spectra. For continuous Hamiltonian evolution, it generalizes Krylov operator complexity to quantum states. We apply our methods to the harmonic and inverted oscillators, particles on group manifolds, the Schwarzian theory, the SYK model, and random matrix models. For time-evolved thermofield double states in chaotic systems our measure shows four regimes: a linear ""ramp"" up to a ""peak"" that is exponential in the entropy, followed by a ""slope"" down to a ""plateau"". These regimes arise in the same physics producing the slope-dip-ramp-plateau structure of the Spectral Form Factor. Specifically, the complexity slope arises from spectral rigidity, distinguishing different random matrix ensembles.",2022-02-14 19:00:00+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevD.106.046007
2107.13874,Chaos in CFT dual to rotating BTZ,Ben Craps ; Surbhi Khetrapal ; Charles Rabideau,hep-th,hep-th,"We compute out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in two-dimensional holographic conformal field theories (CFTs) with different left- and right-moving temperatures. Depending on whether the CFT lives on a spatial line or circle, the dual bulk geometry is a boosted BTZ black brane or a rotating BTZ black hole. In the case when the spatial direction is non-compact, we generalise a computation of Roberts and Stanford and show that to reproduce the correct bulk answer a maximal channel contribution needs to be selected when using the identity block approximation. We use the correspondence between global conformal blocks and geodesic Witten diagrams to extend our results to CFTs on a spatial circle. In arXiv:1908.03574 it was shown that the OTOC for a rotating BTZ black hole exhibits a periodic modulation about an average exponential decay with Lyapunov exponent $2\pi/\beta$. In the extremal limit where the black hole is maximally rotating, it was shown in arXiv:2009.08518 that the OTOC exhibits an average cubic growth, on which is superposed a sawtooth pattern which has small periods of Lyapunov growth due to the non-zero temperature of left-movers in the dual CFT.

Surprisingly, this quantity can also serve to study a completely different physical problem - that of information processing inside black holes. Quantum computational complexity was suggested as a new entry in the holographic dictionary, which extends the connection between geometry and information and resolves the puzzle of why black hole interiors keep growing for a very long time. In this pedagogical review, we present the geometric approach to complexity advocated by Nielsen and show how it can be used to define complexity for generic quantum systems; in particular, we focus on Gaussian states in QFT, both pure and mixed, and on certain classes of CFT states. We then present the conjectured relation to gravitational quantities within the holographic correspondence and discuss several examples in which different versions of the conjectures have been tested. We highlight the relation between complexity, chaos and scrambling in chaotic systems. We conclude with a discussion of open problems and future directions.

Sonner,hep-th,hep-th cond-mat.str-el quant-ph,"We apply a notion of quantum complexity, called ""Krylov complexity"", to study the evolution of systems from integrability to chaos. For this purpose we investigate the integrable XXZ spin chain, enriched with an integrability breaking deformation that allows one to interpolate between integrable and chaotic behavior. K-complexity can act as a probe of the integrable or chaotic nature of the underlying system via its late-time saturation value that is suppressed in the integrable phase and increases as the system is driven to the chaotic phase. We furthermore ascribe the (under-)saturation of the late-time bound to the amount of disorder present in the Lanczos sequence, by mapping the complexity evolution to an auxiliary off-diagonal Anderson hopping model. We compare the late-time saturation of K-complexity in the chaotic phase with that of random matrix ensembles and find that the chaotic system indeed approaches the RMT behavior in the appropriate symmetry class. We investigate the dependence of the results on the two key ingredients of K-complexity: the dynamics of the Hamiltonian and the character of the operator whose time dependence is followed.",2022-07-15 18:51:13+00:00,10.1007/JHEP07(2022)151

The two quantities are motivated by quantum chaos and quantum computation, respectively, while the relevant mathematics is as different as matrix diagonalization algorithms and geodesic flows on curved manifolds. We demonstrate that, despite these differences, there is a relation between the two quantities. Namely, the time average of Krylov complexity of state evolution can be expressed as a trace of a certain matrix, which also controls an upper bound on Nielsen complexity with a specific custom-tailored penalty schedule adapted to the Krylov basis.",2023-11-30 09:51:22+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.160402

When Krylov basis matches with Fock basis, for several interesting settings, we observe that the Krylov complexity equals the average particle number showing that complexity scales with volume. Using similar formalism, we compute the Krylov complexity for free scalar field theory and find surprising similarities with holography.

We start by showing a direct link between a unitary evolution with the Liouvillian and the displacement operator of appropriate generalized coherent states. This connection maps operator growth to a purely classical motion in phase space. The phase spaces are endowed with a natural information metric. We show that, in this geometry, operator growth is represented by geodesics and Krylov complexity is proportional to a volume. This geometric perspective also provides two novel avenues towards computation of Lanczos coefficients and sheds new light on the origin of their maximal growth. We describe the general idea and analyze it in explicit examples among which we reproduce known results from the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, derive operator growth based on SU(2) and Heisenberg-Weyl symmetries, and generalize the discussion to conformal field theories.

It is a measure of operator growth in Krylov space, which conjecturally bounds the operator growth measured by the out of time ordered correlator (OTOC). We study Krylov complexity in conformal field theories by considering arbitrary 2d CFTs, free field, and holographic models. We find that the bound on OTOC provided by Krylov complexity reduces to bound on chaos of Maldacena, Shenker, and Stanford.

The hypothesis states that successive Lanczos coefficients in the continued fraction expansion of the Green's functions grow linearly with rate $\alpha$ in generic systems, with an extra logarithmic correction in 1d. The rate $\alpha$ --- an experimental observable --- governs the exponential growth of operator complexity in a sense we make precise. This exponential growth even prevails beyond semiclassical or large-$N$ limits. Moreover, $\alpha$ upper bounds a large class of operator complexity measures, including the out-of-time-order correlator. As a result, we obtain a sharp bound on Lyapunov exponents $\lambda_L \leq 2 \alpha$, which complements and improves the known universal low-temperature bound $\lambda_L \leq 2 \pi T$. We illustrate our results in paradigmatic examples such as non-integrable spin chains, the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, and classical models.

However, the quantitative understanding of this relation is still an open question. In this work, we introduce and study a map between a computational complexity measure and its holographic counterpart from first principles. We consider quantum circuits built out of conformal transformations in two-dimensional conformal field theory and a complexity measure based on assigning a cost to quantum gates via the Fubini-Study distance. We find a novel geometric object in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetimes that is dual to this distance. This duality also provides a more general map between holographic geometry of anti-de Sitter universes and complexity geometry as defined in information theory, in which each point represents a state and distances between states are measured by the Fubini-Study metric. We apply the newly found duality to the eternal black hole spacetime and discuss both the origin of linear growth of complexity and the switchback effect within our approach.",2022-11-30 19:00:02+00:00,10.48550/2212.00043

This trace can be thought of as the vacuum expectation value of a suitable observable in a system made with n independent copies of the original system. We use this property to numerically evaluate it in some two-dimensional critical systems, where it can be compared with the results of Calabrese and Cardy, who wrote the same quantity in terms of correlation functions of twist fields of a conformal field theory. Although the two calculations match perfectly even in finite systems when the analyzed subsystem consists of a single interval, they disagree whenever the subsystem is composed of more than one connected part. The reasons of this disagreement are explained.",2008-08-29 13:06:06+00:00,10.1088/1126-6708/2008/11/076
1006.0047,Entanglement Renyi entropies in holographic theories,Matthew Headrick,hep-th,hep-th cond-mat.stat-mech quant-ph,"Ryu and Takayanagi conjectured a formula for the entanglement (von Neumann) entropy of an arbitrary spatial region in an arbitrary holographic field theory. The von Neumann entropy is a special case of a more general class of entropies called Renyi entropies. Using Euclidean gravity, Fursaev computed the entanglement Renyi entropies (EREs) of an arbitrary spatial region in an arbitrary holographic field theory, and thereby derived the RT formula. We point out, however, that his EREs are incorrect, since his putative saddle points do not in fact solve the Einstein equation. We remedy this situation in the case of two-dimensional CFTs, considering regions consisting of one or two intervals. For a single interval, the EREs are known for a general CFT; we reproduce them using gravity. For two intervals, the RT formula predicts a phase transition in the entanglement entropy as a function of their separation, and that the mutual information between the intervals vanishes for separations larger than the phase transition point. By computing EREs using gravity and CFT techniques, we find evidence supporting both predictions. We also find evidence that large-$N$ symmetric-product theories have the same EREs as holographic ones.",2010-06-01 02:30:12+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevD.82.126010

We study when, and how much, information about the black hole interior can be accessed through different portions of the Hawking radiation collected in the bath, and we obtain the corresponding full quantitative Page curves. As a refinement of previous results, we describe the island phase transition for a semi-infinite segment of radiation in the bath, establishing access to the interior for times within the regime of applicability of the model. For finite-size segments in the bath, one needs to include the purifier of the black hole microscopic dual together with the radiation segment in order to access the interior information. We identify four scenarios of the entropy evolution in this case, including a possibility where the interior reconstruction window is temporarily interrupted. Analyzing the phase structure of the Page curve of a finite segment with length comparable to the Page time, we demonstrate that it is very sensitive to changes of the parameters of the model. We also discuss the evolution of the subregion complexity of the radiation during the black hole evaporation.",2022-09-30 14:00:02+00:00,10.1007/JHEP02(2023)080
2103.12798,Time-periodicities in holographic CFTs,Ben Craps ; Marine De Clerck ; Oleg Evnin,hep-th,hep-th,"Dynamics in AdS spacetimes is characterized by various time-periodicities. The most obvious of these is the time-periodic evolution of linearized fields, whose normal frequencies form integer-spaced ladders as a direct consequence of the structure of representations of the conformal group. There are also explicitly known time-periodic phenomena on much longer time scales inversely proportional to the coupling in the weakly nonlinear regime. We ask what would correspond to these long time periodicities in a holographic CFT, provided that such a CFT reproducing the AdS bulk dynamics in the large central charge limit has been found. The answer is a very large family of multiparticle operators whose conformal dimensions form simple ladders with spacing inversely proportional to the central charge. We give an explicit demonstration of these ideas in the context of a toy model holography involving a $\phi^4$ probe scalar field in AdS, but we expect the applicability of the underlying structure to be much more general.",2021-03-23 19:02:47+00:00,10.1007/JHEP09(2021)030
2301.07108,Quantum Error Correction from Complexity in Brownian SYK,Vijay Balasubramanian ; Arjun Kar ; Cathy Li ; Onkar Parrikar ; Harshit Rajgadia,hep-th,hep-th quant-ph,"We study the robustness of quantum error correction in a one-parameter ensemble of codes generated by the Brownian SYK model, where the parameter quantifies the encoding complexity. The robustness of error correction by a quantum code is upper bounded by the ""mutual purity"" of a certain entangled state between the code subspace and environment in the isometric extension of the error channel, where the mutual purity of a density matrix $\rho_{AB}$ is the difference $\mathcal{F}_\rho (A:B) \equiv \mathrm{Tr}\;\rho_{AB}^2 - \mathrm{Tr}\;\rho_A^2\;\mathrm{Tr}\;\rho_B^2$. We show that when the encoding complexity is small, the mutual purity is $O(1)$ for the erasure of a small number of qubits (i.e., the encoding is fragile). However, this quantity decays exponentially, becoming $O(1/N)$ for $O(\log N)$ encoding complexity. Further, at polynomial encoding complexity, the mutual purity saturates to a plateau of $O(e^{-N})$. We also find a hierarchy of complexity scales associated to a tower of subleading contributions to the mutual purity that quantitatively, but not qualitatively, adjust our error correction bound as encoding complexity increases. In the AdS/CFT context, our results suggest that any portion of the entanglement wedge of a general boundary subregion $A$ with sufficiently high encoding complexity is robustly protected against low-rank errors acting on $A$ with no prior access to the encoding map. From the bulk point of view, we expect such bulk degrees of freedom to be causally inaccessible from the region $A$ despite being encoded in it.",2023-01-17 19:00:00+00:00,10.1007/JHEP08(2023)071

This constitutes the first step toward a covariantly stable and causal formulation of first-order fluctuating hydrodynamics based on thermodynamic principles. We provide several explicit examples of first-order theories with an information current, covering many physical phenomena, ranging from electric conduction to viscosity and elasticity. We use these information currents to compute the corresponding equal-time correlation functions, and we find that the physically relevant (equal-time) correlators do not depend on the choice of the hydrodynamic frame as long as the frame leads to causal and stable dynamics.

2401.13292,Transport and information in open quantum systems,Kasper Poulsen,quant-ph,quant-ph cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.stat-mech,"With the approaching second quantum revolution, the study of quantum thermodynamics, particularly heat flow, has become even more relevant for two main reasons. First, understanding heat and other types of noise is essential for protecting quantum information and preventing decoherence. Second, the ability to manufacture and control quantum systems developed for the quantum computer allows for experimental study of quantum thermodynamics in entirely new settings. In this thesis, several systems involving quantum systems in contact with baths are studied theoretically in experimentally available settings. First, two rectification or diode setups for heat currents are proposed using a dark-state mechanism. In one system, the dark-state mechanism is imperfect but very robust. In the other system, the dark-state mechanism relies on quantum entanglement and is much better but more fragile towards decoherence. Next, a quantum version of the Wheatstone bridge is built using the same entanglement-powered dark state mechanism. After having studied several boundary-driven quantum systems, the lessons learned are generalized into resonance conditions using a general linear chain of weakly interacting chains of strongly interacting spins. The final two chapters focus on the ability to study statistical physics in realizable quantum systems. First, a Maxwell's demon setup is proposed. A demon-controlled qutrit is coupled to two non-Markovian baths. The information back-flow from the non-Markovian baths allows the demon to more effectively transfer heat from the cold bath to the hot bath. Second, the Mott insulator to superfluid phase transition in a lattice of transmons is examined. The ground state has a variable particle number and is prepared using adiabatic state preparation. This allows for the exploration of the entire phase diagram.",2024-01-24 08:26:48+00:00,10.48550/2401.13292
2401.13039,Penrose process in Reissner-Nordström-AdS black hole spacetimes: Black hole energy factories and black hole bombs,Duarte Feiteira ; José P. S. Lemos ; Oleg B. Zaslavskii,gr-qc,gr-qc astro-ph.HE hep-th,"The Penrose process for the decay of electrically charged particles in a Reissner-Nordstr\""om-anti-de Sitter black hole spacetime is studied. To extract large quantities of energy one needs to mount a recursive Penrose process where particles are confined and can bounce back to suffer ever again a decaying process in the black hole electric ergoregion. In an asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, two situations of confinement are possible. One situation uses a reflecting mirror at some radius, which obliges the energetic outgoing particles to return to the decaying point. The other situation uses the natural AdS property that sends back at some intrinsic returning radius those outgoing energetic particles. In addition, besides the conservation laws the decaying process must obey, one has to set conditions at the decaying point for the particles debris. These conditions restrain the possible scenarios, but there are still a great number of available scenarios for the decays. Within these, we choose two scenarios, scenario 1 and scenario 2, that pertain to the masses and electric charges of the final particles. Thus, in the mirror situation we find that scenario 1 leads to a black hole energy factory, and scenario 2 ends in a black hole bomb. In the no mirror situation, i.e., pure Reissner-Nordstr\""om-AdS, scenario 1 leads again to a black hole energy factory, but scenario 2 yields no bomb. This happens because the volume in which the particles are confined increases to infinity along the chain of decays, leading to a zero value of the extracted energy per unit volume and the bomb is demined. The whole treatment performed here involves no backreaction on the black hole mass and electric charge, nevertheless we speculate that the end state of the recursive process is a Reissner-Nordstr\""om-AdS black hole with very short hair, i.e., with one particle at rest at some definite radius.",2024-01-23 19:00:06+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevD.109.064065

Part of the statement is that the off-diagonal elements fall exponential for large energy difference. We propose that the exponent ($\gamma>0$) is a measure of quantum chaos. Smaller $\gamma$ implies more chaotic dynamics. The chaos bound is given by $\gamma=\beta/4$ where $\beta$ is the inverse temperature. We give analytical argument in support of this proposal. The slower exponential fall also means that the action of the operator on a state leads to higher delocalization in energy eigenbasis. Numerically we compare two chaotic Hamiltonians - SYK model and chaotic XXZ spin chain. Using the new measure, we find that the SYK model becomes maximally chaotic at low temperature which has been shown rigorously in previous works. The new measure is more readily accessible compare to other measures using numerical methods.",2024-01-24 18:01:49+00:00,10.48550/2401.13633

While in ordinary models of inflationary cosmology the dark energy sector is just considered. Dynamical field equations are nonlinear and so they have not exact analytic solutions in general form. On the other side to find equation of state of a back hole by horizon equation we need an analytic form of the metric field solutions.

This phase space consists of the directed edges of a graph with \(V\) vertices that are in one-to-one correspondence with the non-vanishing off-diagonal elements of \(H\). The correspondence between quantum Poincar\'e map and classical Poincar\'e-Markov map is an alternative to the standard quantum-classical correspondence based on a classical limit \(\hbar \to 0\). Most importantly it can be constructed where no such limit exists. Using standard methods from ergodic theory we then proceed to define an expression for the \textit{Lyapunov exponent} \(\Lambda(E)\) of the classical map. It measures the rate of loss of classical information in the dynamics and relates it to the separation of stochastic \textit{classical trajectories} in the phase space.

We then use these chaotic states to compute the equation of state of the model, obtaining results consistent with Conformal Field Theory (CFT) expectations at temperatures above the scale of relevant interactions. We also test the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis by computing the expectation value of local operators in eigenstates, and check that their behavior is consistent with thermal CFT values at high temperatures. Finally, we compute the Spectral Form Factor (SFF), which has the expected behavior associated with the equation of state at short times and chaos at long times.

Recent experiments showing an unexpected linear-in-field, $B$, magnetoresistivity have deepened the puzzle. We propose a simple model of itinerant electrons, interacting via random couplings with electrons localized on a lattice of quantum 'dots' or 'islands'. This model is solvable in a large-$N$ limit, and can reproduce observed behavior. The key feature of our model is that the electrons in each quantum dot are described by a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model describing electrons without quasiparticle excitations. For a particular choice of the interaction between the itinerant and localized electrons, this model realizes a controlled description of a diffusive marginal-Fermi liquid (MFL) without momentum conservation, which has a linear-in-$T$ resistivity and a $T \ln T$ specific heat as $T\rightarrow 0$. By tuning the strength of this interaction relative to the bandwidth of the itinerant electrons, we can additionally obtain a finite-$T$ crossover to a fully incoherent regime that also has a linear-in-$T$ resistivity. We show that the MFL regime has conductivities which scale as a function of $B/T$; however, its magnetoresistance saturates at large $B$. We then consider a macroscopically disordered sample with domains of MFLs with varying densities of electrons. Using an effective-medium approximation, we obtain a macroscopic electrical resistance that scales linearly in the magnetic field $B$ applied perpendicular to the plane of the sample, at large $B$. The resistance also scales linearly in $T$ at small $B$, and as $T f(B/T)$ at intermediate $B$. We consider implications for recent experiments reporting linear transverse magnetoresistance in the strange metal phases of the pnictides and cuprates.",2017-12-13 22:07:59+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevX.8.021049

In this paper, we propose a method to encode the lattice structure by embedding the tight binding data into the Dirac equation in the AdS bulk. We explicitly worked out the idea for the Graphene and Haldane model, and the result shows that some degrees of freedom escape the free-electron on-shell curve, and Green's function loses the pole structure completely. It implies that the electronic structure is not described by the band structure only, which is consistent with what many ARPES data tell us, and it also implies that the system is in non-fermi liquid even for the graphene, which is consistent with recent experiments for the clean graphene.",2024-01-15 06:35:36+00:00,10.48550/2401.07498

This significantly saves computational resources and time needed to compute the coefficient square matrices of the derivatives. In the second method, we illustrate the effectiveness of the weighted residual method in QNMs calculations by using the collocation method and Galerkin method as examples.

Solving this problem exactly is challenging so we restrict to perturbative corrections that one can obtain using the heat kernel expansion in the one-loop effective action for electrons. Starting from the corrections originally computed by Drummond and Hathrell, we solve the full semiclassical Einstein-Maxwell system of coupled equations to leading order in Planck's constant, and find a new electrically charged, static black hole solution. To probe these quantum corrections, we study electromagnetic and gravitational (axial) perturbations on this background, and derive the coupled system of Regge-Wheeler master equations that govern the propagation of these waves. In the classical limit our results agree with previous findings in the literature. We finally compare these results with those that one can obtain by working out the Euler-Heisenberg effective action. We find again a new electrically charged static black hole spacetime, and derive the coupled system of Regge-Wheeler equations governing the propagation of axial electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations. Results are qualitatively similar in both cases.

It is one of the tools to diagnose quantum chaos and unravel the universal dynamics therein. The definition of SFF in most literature only encapsulates the two-level correlation. In this manuscript, we extend the definition of SSF to include the high-order correlation. Specifically, we introduce the standard deviation of energy levels to define correlation functions, from which the generalized spectral form factor (GSFF) can be obtained by Fourier transforms. GSFF provides a more comprehensive knowledge of the dynamics of chaotic systems. Using random matrices as examples, we demonstrate new dynamics features that are encoded in GSFF. Remarkably, the GSFF is complex, and both the real and imaginary parts exhibit universal dynamics. For instance, in the two-level correlated case, the real part of GSFF shows a dip-ramp-plateau structure akin to the conventional counterpart, and the imaginary part for different system sizes converges in the long time limit. For the two-level GSFF, the closed analytical forms of the real part are obtained and consistent with numerical results. The results of the imaginary part are obtained by numerical calculation. Similar analyses are extended to three-level GSFF.",2024-01-04 07:58:47+00:00,10.48550/2401.02119

The spectral form factor corresponds to the Fourier transform of the two-point spectral correlation function and exhibits a typical slope-dip-ramp-plateau structure (aka correlation hole) when the system is chaotic. We discuss how this structure could be detected through the dynamics of two physical quantities accessible to experimental many-body quantum systems: the survival probability and the spin autocorrelation function.

We consider an extension of the standard diagnostics of quantum chaos, namely the complex level spacing ratio and out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), to study the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum kicked rotor model. The kicked rotor has long been regarded as a paradigmatic dynamic system to study classical and quantum chaos. By introducing non-Hermiticity in the quantum kicked rotor, we uncover new phases and transitions that are absent in the Hermitian system. From the study of the complex level spacing ratio, we locate three regimes -- one which is integrable and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, another which is chaotic with $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry and a third which is chaotic but with broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry. We find that the complex level spacing ratio can distinguish between all three phases. Since calculations of the OTOC can be related to those of the classical Lyapunov exponent in the semi-classical limit, we investigate its nature in these regimes and at the phase boundaries. In the phases with $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, the OTOC exhibits behaviour akin to what is observed in the Hermitian system in both the integrable and chaotic regimes. Moreover, in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken phase, the OTOC demonstrates additional exponential growth stemming from the complex nature of the eigenvalue spectrum at later times. We derive the analytical form of the late-time behaviour of the OTOC. By defining a normalized OTOC to mitigate the effects caused by $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking, we show that the OTOC exhibits singular behaviour at the transition from the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric chaotic phase to the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken, chaotic phase.",2024-01-14 06:47:59+00:00,10.48550/2401.07215

Symmetry operators arise from topological field theories localized on a subspace of the boundary CFT spacetime. We use bottom up considerations to construct the topological sector associated with their bulk counterparts. In particular, by exploiting the structure of entanglement wedge reconstruction we argue that the bulk counterpart has a non-topological worldvolume action, i.e., it describes a dynamical object. As a consequence, we find that there are no global $p$-form symmetries for $p \geq 0$ in asymptotically AdS spacetimes, which includes the case of non-invertible symmetries. Provided one has a suitable notion of subregion-subregion duality, our argument for the absence of bulk global symmetries applies to more general spacetimes. These considerations also motivate us to consider for general QFTs (holographic or not) the notion of lower-form symmetries, namely, $(-m)$-form symmetries for $m \geq 2$.",2024-01-17 19:00:04+00:00,10.48550/2401.09538

Here, we present a perturbed free quantum circuit model, in which ergodicity is induced by an impurity interaction placed on the system's boundary, that allows for demonstrating the underlying mechanism. This is achieved by mapping dynamical correlation functions of local operators acting at the boundary to a partition function with complex weights defined on a two dimensional lattice with a helical topology. We evaluate this partition function in terms of transfer matrices, which allow for numerically treating system sizes far beyond what is accessible by exact diagonalization and whose spectral properties determine the asymptotic scaling of correlations. Combining analytical arguments with numerical results we show that for impurities which remain unitary under partial transpose correlations are exponentially suppressed with system size in a particular scaling limit.

It describes $N$ strongly coupled Majorana fermions with random all-to-all interactions, with unitary evolution given by a quartic Hamiltonian and the coupling to the environment described by $M$ quadratic jump operators, rendering the full Lindbladian quartic in the Majorana operators. Analytical progress is possible by developing a dynamical mean-field theory for the Liouvillian time evolution on the Keldysh contour. By disorder-averaging the interactions, we derive an (exact) effective action for two collective fields (Green's function and self-energy). In the large-$N$, large-$M$ limit, we obtain the saddle-point equations satisfied by the collective fields, which determine the typical timescales of the dissipative evolution, particularly, the spectral gap that rules the relaxation of the system to its steady state. We solve the saddle-point equations numerically and find that, for strong or intermediate dissipation, the system relaxes exponentially, with a spectral gap that can be computed analytically, while for weak dissipation, there are oscillatory corrections to the exponential relaxation.

This consists of a free, non-interacting brickwork quantum circuit, in which chaos and ergodicity is induced by an impurity interaction, i.e., an entangling two-qudit gate, placed at the system's boundary. We compute both the conventional bipartite entanglement entropy with respect to a connected subsystem including the impurity interaction for initial product states as well as the so-called operator entanglement entropy of initial local operators. Thereby we provide exact results in a particular scaling limit of both time and system size going to infinity for either very small or very large subsystems. We show that different classes of impurity interactions lead to very distinct entanglement dynamics. For impurity gates preserving a local product state forming the bulk of the initial state, entanglement entropies of states show persistent spikes with period set by the system size and suppressed entanglement in between, contrary to the expected linear growth in ergodic systems. We observe similar dynamics of operator entanglement for generic impurities. In contrast, for T-dual impurities, which remain unitary under partial transposition, we find entanglement entropies of both states and operators to grow linearly in time with the maximum possible speed allowed by the geometry of the system. The intensive nature of interactions in all cases cause entanglement to grow on extensive time scales proportional to system size.",2023-01-19 16:58:57+00:00,10.21468/SciPostPhys.15.3.092

We test the ETH in a nonintegrable model of relativistic quantum field theory (QFT) using the numerical method of Hamiltonian truncation in combination with analytical arguments based on Lorentz symmetry and renormalisation group theory. We find that there is an infinite sequence of eigenstates with the characteristics of quantum many-body scars, that is, exceptional eigenstates with observable expectation values that lie far from thermal values, and we show that these states are one-quasiparticle states. We argue that in the thermodynamic limit the eigenstates cover the entire area between two diverging lines: the line of one-quasiparticle states, whose direction is dictated by relativistic kinematics, and the thermal average line. Our results suggest that the strong version of the ETH is violated in any relativistic QFT whose spectrum admits a quasiparticle description.",2023-03-27 11:52:53+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.021601

The distinctly non-Gaussian statistics of magnetization transfer in the easy-axis regime is found to converge towards the universal distribution of charged single-file systems.

These are deterministic classical many-body dynamical systems which can be interpreted in terms of symplectic dynamics in two orthogonal (time and space) directions. In close analogy with quantum dual-unitary circuits, we prove that two-point dynamical correlation functions are non-vanishing only along the edges of the light cones. The dynamical correlations are exactly computable in terms of a one-site Markov transfer operator, which is generally of infinite dimensionality. We test our theory in a specific family of dual-symplectic circuits, describing the dynamics of a classical Floquet spin chain. Remarkably, expressing these models in the form of a composition of rotations leads to a transfer operator with a block diagonal form in the basis of spherical harmonics. This allows us to obtain analytical predictions for simple local observables. We demonstrate the validity of our theory by comparison with Monte Carlo simulations, displaying excellent agreement with the latter for different choices of observables.",2023-07-04 15:48:41+00:00,10.48550/2307.01786

We exactly calculate the latter in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension $q$ for different classes of random boundary interactions and find it to coincide with random matrix theory, possibly after a non-zero Thouless time. The latter effect is due to a drastic enhancement of the spectral form factor, when integer time and system size fulfill a resonance condition.

We study the relationship between Lyapunov exponents and black hole phase transitions considering both the timelike and null geodesics. We observe that, the black hole phase transiton properties are reflected in Lyapunov exponent where its multiple branches correspond to the distinct phases of the black hole. The discontinuos change of the Lyapunov exponent during the phase transition serve as an order parameter with critical exponent $1/2$ near the critical point.

Keeping in mind the gauge/gravity duality framework, the non-conformality in the dual field theory has been introduced by considering a Liouville type dilaton potential for the gravitational theory. The resulting black brane solution is associated with a parameter $\eta$ which represents the deviation from conformality. The parameters of chaos, namely, the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity are computed by following the well-known shock wave analysis. The obtained results reveal that presence of non-conformality leads to suppression of the chaotic nature of a system. Further, for a particular value of the non-conformal parameter $\eta$, the system achieves Lyapunov stability resulting from the vanishing of both the Lyapunov exponent and as well as butterfly velocity. Interestingly, this particular value of $\eta$ matches with the previously given upper bound of $\eta$ known as Gubser bound in the literature. The effects of chaos and non-conformality on the existing correlation of a thermofield doublet state have been quantified by holographically computing the thermo mutual information in both the presence and absence of the shock wave. Furthermore, the entanglement velocity is also computed and the effect of non-conformality on it has been observed. Finally, the obtained results for the Lyapunov exponent and the butterfly velocity have also been computed from the pole-skipping analysis.

We extend these ideas to cases where the background geometry is non-AdS, and the gravity description of the dual confining field theory has a top-down origin in supergravity. We exemplify this programme by studying the circle compactification of Romans six-dimensional half-maximal supergravity. We uncover a rich space of solutions, many of which were previously unknown in the literature. We compute the bosonic spectrum of excitations, and identify a tachyonic instability in a region of parameter space for a class of regular background solutions.

Two subjects are presented in the manuscript, both aiming at studying the effect of the spin of elementary particles on otherwise known theories. First is a study of the L\'evy-Leblond-Newton (LLN) equation, which is used to describe the evolution of a quantum system with spin 1/2 that is coupled to its own gravitational potential. After reviewing some symmetries of non relativistic Quantum Mechanics, and how to geometrize them with the help of Bargmann structures, we recall what is the L\'evy-Leblond equation. In this chapter, the LLN equation is described in a fully covariant way on Bargmann structures. This covariant formulation then helps to derive the dynamical symmetries of the equation, and conserved quantities. The symmetry group of this equation turns out to be the already known Schr\""odinger-Newton group. The second part deals with the trajectory of particles with spin in General Relativity. We first highlight Souriau's geometric method to derive the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) equations, and then discuss the different possible Spin Supplementary Conditions (SSC) that exist to close the system of MPD equations. In this chapter, we assume the Tulczyjew SSC to describe the trajectory of photons, leading to the Souriau-Saturnini equations. We then present some works where we have applied these equations, in a Schwarzschild spacetime, and in a spacetime deformed by a gravitational wave. In the first work, we found gravitational birefringence: the trajectory deviates from the geodesic plane, depending on the helicity of the photon and its wavelength. The second work presented also found birefringence in gravitational interferometry experiments, however the effect is many orders of magnitude lower than what we can detect.",2021-03-29 21:59:24+00:00,10.48550/2103.17074

Second, it introduces and compares two proposals for gravitational energy and momentum, one of which is very influential in physics: and, so far as I know, neither of the two has been discussed in the philosophical literature. Third, it assesses these proposals in connection with recent philosophical discussions of energy and momentum in general relativity. After briefly reviewing the debates about energy conservation between Hilbert, Klein, Noether and Einstein, I give Noether's two theorems. I show that Einstein's gravitational energy-momentum pseudo-tensor, including its superpotential, is fixed, through Noether's theorem, by the boundary terms in the action. That is, the freedom to add an arbitrary superpotential to the gravitational pseudo-tensor corresponds to the freedom to add boundary terms to the action without changing the equations of motion. This freedom is fixed in the same way for both problems. I also review two proposals for energy and momentum in GR, of which one is a quasi-local alternative to the local expressions, and the other builds on Einstein's local pseudo-tensor approach. I discuss the recent philosophical literature on the conservation of energy and momentum in general relativity, and I assess and compare the two proposals in the light of this literature: especially, in light of questions about diffeomorphism invariance and background-independence.",2021-03-31 15:24:31+00:00,10.48550/2103.17160

Lemos ; Paulo Luz,gr-qc,gr-qc hep-th math-ph math.MP,"We classify all fundamental electrically charged thin shells in general relativity, i.e., static spherically symmetric perfect fluid thin shells with a Minkowski spacetime interior and a Reissner-Nordstr\""om spacetime exterior, characterized by the spacetime mass and electric charge. The fundamental shell can exist in three states, nonextremal, extremal, and overcharged. The nonextremal state allows the shell to be located such that its radius can be outside its own gravitational radius, or can be inside its own Cauchy radius. The extremal state allows the shell to be located such that its radius can be outside its own gravitational radius, or can be inside it. The overcharged state allows the shell to be located anywhere. There is a further division, one has to specify the orientation of the shell, i.e., whether the normal out of the shell points toward increasing or decreasing radii. There is still a subdivision in the extremal state when the shell is at the gravitational radius, in that the shell can approach it from above or from below. The shell is assumed to be composed of an electrically charged perfect fluid, and the energy conditions are tested. Carter-Penrose diagrams are drawn for the shell spacetimes. There are fourteen cases in the classification of the fundamental shells, namely, nonextremal star shells, nonextremal tension shell black holes, nonextremal tension shell regular and nonregular black holes, nonextremal compact shell naked singularities, Majumdar-Papapetrou star shells, extremal tension shell singularities, extremal tension shell regular and nonregular black holes, Majumdar-Papapetrou compact shell naked singularities, Majumdar-Papapetrou shell quasiblack holes, extremal null shell quasinonblack holes, extremal null shell singularities, Majumdar-Papapetrou null shell singularities, overcharged star shells, and overcharged compact shell naked singularities.",2021-03-29 18:00:01+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevD.103.104046

In this initial paper we restrict our attention to spherically symmetric spacetimes made dynamic by matter fields. We illustrate the formalism by considering a black hole interacting with a) inward-falling, null matter (with no outward flux) and b) a massless scalar field. The inward-falling case can be exactly solved from horizon data. For the more involved case of the scalar field we analytically investigate the near slowly evolving horizon regime and propose a numerical integration for the general case.",2019-05-07 18:11:11+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevD.100.064019

In this work, we introduce a supervised learning algorithm for studying critical phenomena from measurement data, which is based on iteratively training convolutional networks of increasing complexity, and test it on the transverse field Ising chain and q=6 Potts model. At the continuous Ising transition, we identify scaling behavior in the classification accuracy, from which we infer a characteristic classification length scale. It displays a power-law divergence at the critical point, with a scaling exponent that matches with the diverging correlation length. Our algorithm correctly identifies the thermodynamic phase of the system and extracts scaling behavior from projective measurements, independently of the basis in which the measurements are performed. Furthermore, we show the classification length scale is absent for the $q=6$ Potts model, which has a first order transition and thus lacks a divergent correlation length. The main intuition underlying our finding is that, for measurement patches of sizes smaller than the correlation length, the system appears to be at the critical point, and therefore the algorithm cannot identify the phase from which the data was drawn.",2021-03-29 18:05:27+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.L022032

Hamed Mohammady,quant-ph,quant-ph cond-mat.stat-mech,"Quantum measurement is ultimately a physical process, resulting from an interaction between the measured system and a measuring apparatus. Considering the physical process of measurement within a thermodynamic context naturally raises the following question: How can the work and heat be interpreted? In the present paper we model the measurement process for an arbitrary discrete observable as a measurement scheme. Here the system to be measured is first unitarily coupled with an apparatus and subsequently the compound system is objectified with respect to a pointer observable, thus producing definite measurement outcomes. The work can therefore be interpreted as the change in internal energy of the compound system due to the unitary coupling. By the first law of thermodynamics, the heat is the subsequent change in internal energy of this compound due to pointer objectification. We argue that the apparatus serves as a stable record for the measurement outcomes only if the pointer observable commutes with the Hamiltonian and show that such commutativity implies that the uncertainty of heat will necessarily be classical.",2021-03-29 16:43:43+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevA.104.062202

Theor. 53, 115303 (2020)], we have introduced a set of noncommutative algebra that describes the space-time at the Planck scale. The interesting significant result we found is that the generalized uncertainty principle induced a maximal length of quantum gravity which has different physical implications to the one of generalized uncertainty principle with minimal length. The emergence of a maximal length in this theory revealed strong quantum gravitational effects at this scale and predicted the detection of gravity particles with low energies. To make evidence of these predictions, we study the dynamics of a free particle confined in an infinite square well potential in one dimension of this space. Since the effects of quantum gravity are strong in this space, we show that the energy spectrum of this system is weakly proportional to the ordinary one of quantum mechanics free of the theory of gravity. The states of this particle exhibit proprieties similar to the standard coherent states which are consequences of quantum fluctuation at this scale. Then, with the spectrum of this system at hand, we analyze the thermodynamic quantities within the canonical and microcanonical ensembles of an ideal gas made up of $N$ indistinguishable particles at the Planck scale. The results show a complete consistency between both statistical descriptions. Furthermore, a comparison with the results obtained in the context of minimal length scenarios and black hole theories indicates that the maximal length in this theory induces logarithmic corrections of deformed parameters which are consequences of a strong quantum gravitational effect.",2021-02-26 23:57:23+00:00,10.48550/2103.00089

The $N$-point correlation function that satisfy conformal constraints have been constructed from a non-conformal vacuum and the insertion of a non-primary operator. The main goal of this paper is to find an interpretation of this oddness. For this purpouse, we study possible gravitational dual models and propose a two-dimensional dilaton gravity with a massless fermion for the description of conformal quantum mechanics. We find a universal correspondence between states in the conformal quantum mechanics model and two-dimensional spacetimes. Moreover, the solutions of the Dirac equation can be interpreted as zero modes of a Floquet-Dirac system. Within this system, the oddness of the non-conformal vacuum and non-primary operator is elucidated. As a possible application, we interpret the gauge symmetries of the Floquet-Dirac system as the corresponding infinite symmetries of the Schr\""odinger equation which are conjectured to be related to higher spin symmetries.",2021-03-28 23:47:33+00:00,10.48550/2103.15248

Here, the dynamics of both the dual order-parameter field and the metric tensor field originate from density-density and energy-momentum tensor-tensor effective interactions, respectively, in the recursive renormalization group transformation, performed approximately in the Gaussian level. This linear approximation in the recursive renormalization group transformation for the gravity sector gives rise to a linearized quantum Einstein-scalar theory along the $z-$directional emergent space. In the large $N$ limit, where $N$ is the flavor number of the original scalar fields, quantum fluctuations of both dynamical metric and dual scalar fields are suppressed, leading to a classical field theory of the Einstein-scalar type in $(D+1)$-spacetime dimensions. We show that this emergent background gravity describes the renormalization group flows of coupling functions in the UV quantum field theory through the extra dimension. More precisely, the IR boundary conditions of the gravity equations correspond to the renormalization group $\beta$-functions of the quantum field theory, where the infinitesimal distance in the extra-dimensional space is identified with an energy scale for the renormalization group transformation. Finally, we also show that this dual holographic formulation describes quantum entanglement in a geometrical way, encoding the transfer of quantum entanglement from quantum matter to classical gravity in the large $N$ limit. We claim that this entanglement transfer serves as a microscopic foundation for the emergent holographic duality description.",2020-02-29 03:06:01+00:00,10.1007/JHEP05(2021)260

Patel ; Subir Sachdev,cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.str-el hep-th,"We describe the large $N$ saddle point, and the structure of fluctuations about the saddle point, of a theory containing a sharp, critical Fermi surface in two spatial dimensions. The theory describes the onset of Ising order in a Fermi liquid, and closely related theories apply to other cases with critical Fermi surfaces. We employ random couplings in flavor space between the fermions and the bosonic order parameter, but there is no spatial randomness: consequently, the $G$-$\Sigma$ path integral of the theory is expressed in terms of fields bilocal in spacetime. The critical exponents of the large $N$ saddle-point are the same as in the well-studied non-random RPA theory; in particular, the entropy density vanishes in the limit of zero temperature. We present a full numerical solution of the large $N$ saddle-point equations, and the results agree with the critical behavior obtained analytically. Following analyses of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models, we describe scaling operators which descend from fermion bilinears around the Fermi surface. This leads to a systematic consideration of the role of time reparameterization symmetry, and the scaling of the Cooper pairing and $2k_F$ operators which can determine associated instabilities of the critical Fermi surface. We find no violations of scaling from time reparameterizations. We also consider the same model but with spatially random couplings: this provides a systematic large $N$ theory of a marginal Fermi liquid with Planckian transport.",2021-03-15 18:00:11+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevB.103.235129

Specifically, we consider particle production in simple expanding backgrounds, preheating after $R^2$ inflation, and a transition model with smoothly changing mass.

While a thermal equilibrium state of the self-gravitating particle system cannot have a finite mass without an artificial wall in the asymptotically flat case, in the asymptotically AdS case, the total mass can be finite without any artificial wall due to the AdS potential barrier. In this case, the typical size of the system is characterized by the AdS radius. The equilibrium states can be parametrized by two independent parameters. Taking the total rest mass as the unit and fixing the AdS radius, we obtain the one-parameter family of equilibria which describes a curve in the parameter space spanned by the gravothermal energy and the temperature. Then we investigate the instability of the system based on the turning point method for each value of the AdS radius. We find that the curve typically has a double spiral structure as in the asymptotically flat case with an artificial wall. The possible value of the gravothermal energy is restricted to the finite region between the first turning points on the two respective spirals.",2021-03-25 09:42:46+00:00,10.1088/1361-6382/ac129e

We consider the volume of the parameter space measured with the quantum metric, which we call the quantum volume of the parameter space. We establish an inequality between the quantum volume of the Brillouin zone and that of the twist-angle space. Exploiting this inequality and the inequality between the Chern number and the quantum volume, we investigate how the quantum volume can be used as a good measure to infer the Chern number. The inequalities are found to be saturated for fermions filling Landau levels.

We show that these terms correspond to distinct phases of matter and also uncover intrinsically quasicrystalline phases, which have no crystalline analogues. For quasicrystals with internal $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry, we discuss a number of interpretations and physical implications of the topological terms, including constraints on the mobility of dislocations in $d=2$ quasicrystals and a quasicrystalline generalization of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-Oshikawa-Hastings theorem. We then extend these ideas much further and address the complete classification of quasicrystalline topological phases, including systems with point-group symmetry as well as non-invertible phases.

Quench may lead to damage or even to catastrophic conductor failure. A superconductor is stable if it does not quench. Exact determination of superconductor transient, resistive states (flux flow, Ohmic) thus is mandatory to safely avoid quench. This request sharp comparison of local, transient conductor temperature and current transport density with local values of critical superconductor temperature, TCrit, and critical current density, JCrit, and the latter is a strong function of temperature. Numerical, Finite Element simulations reported previously and in this paper have provided the requested, transient temperature distribution; under disturbances, this distribution may strongly be non-uniform. But what happens if the other variable, TCrit, might not uniquely be defined? A multi-physics model (fractional parentage, Pauli selection rule, time of flight-concept with a mediating Boson, the Yukawa model and the uncertainty principle) provides relaxation time at which TCrit, as the thermodynamic, equilibrium state, finally would be obtained. But relaxation time diverges the closer the electron system approaches the phase transition, which questions existence of uniquely defined TCrit within finite process time. In this paper, focus is on multiple internal heat transfer (solid conduction and, in thin films, radiation), a suggested operator method to solve the incompleteness problem of radiative transfer, and time dependence of the order parameter obtained from the quantum-mechanical model.

The Fermi projector, i.e. the projector onto the occupied bands, provides a map to a K\""ahler manifold. The quantum metric and Berry curvature of the occupied bands are then related to the Riemannian metric and symplectic form, respectively, on the target space of quantum states. We find that the minimal volume of a parameter space with respect to the quantum metric is $\pi |\mathcal{C}|$, where $\mathcal{C}$ is the first Chern number. We determine the conditions under which the minimal volume is achieved both for the Brillouin zone and the twist-angle space. The minimal volume of the Brillouin zone, provided the quantum metric is everywhere non-degenerate, is achieved when the latter is endowed with the structure of a K\""ahler manifold inherited from the one of the space of quantum states. If the quantum volume of the twist-angle torus is minimal, then both parameter spaces have the structure of a K\""ahler manifold inherited from the space of quantum states. These conditions turn out to be related to the stability of fractional Chern insulators. For two-band systems, the volume of the Brillouin zone is naturally minimal provided the Berry curvature is everywhere non-negative or nonpositive, and we additionally show how the latter, which in this case is proportional to the quantum volume form, necessarily has zeros due to topological constraints.",2021-03-22 05:02:58+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevB.104.045104

For simplicity we focus on massive Dirac fermions with nonzero chemical potential, and work in $1+1$ space-time dimensions. Using the entanglement entropy on an interval, we construct an entropic $c$-function that is finite. Unlike what happens in Lorentz-invariant theories, this $c$-function exhibits a strong violation of monotonicity; it also encodes the creation of long-range entanglement from the Fermi surface. Motivated by previous works on lattice models, we next calculate numerically the Renyi entropies and find Friedel-type oscillations; these are understood in terms of a defect operator product expansion. Furthermore, we consider the mutual information as a measure of correlation functions between different regions. Using a long-distance expansion previously developed by Cardy, we argue that the mutual information detects Fermi surface correlations already at leading order in the expansion. We also analyze the relative entropy and its Renyi generalizations in order to distinguish states with different charge and/or mass. In particular, we show that states in different superselection sectors give rise to a super-extensive behavior in the relative entropy.

A generalized, self-consistent Hamiltonian was therefore constructed for an arbitrary quantum-mechanical system in a way that the ground-state Hamiltonian turned out to be just a limiting case at absolute zero. The weak-coupling term connecting the system of interest and its immediate environment was accordingly treated as the perturbation. Applying the obtained generalized Hamiltonian to some typical quantum systems with exact zero-temperature solutions, including the free particle in a box, the free particle in vacuum, and the harmonic oscillator, up to the first order of self-consistency, therefore corrected their associated Hamiltonians, energy spectrums, and wavefunctions to be consistent with the low-temperature limit.

2106.13269,Low temperature quantum bounds on simple models,Silvia Pappalardi ; Jorge Kurchan,hep-th,hep-th cond-mat.stat-mech quant-ph,"In the past few years, there has been considerable activity around a set of quantum bounds on transport coefficients (viscosity) and chaos (Lyapunov exponent), relevant at low temperatures. The interest comes from the fact that Black-Hole models seem to saturate all of them. The goal of this work is to gain physical intuition about the quantum mechanisms that enforce these bounds on simple models. To this aim, we consider classical and quantum free dynamics on curved manifolds. These systems exhibit chaos up to the lowest temperatures and - as we discuss - they violate the bounds in the classical limit. First of all, we show that the quantum dimensionless viscosity and the Lyapunov exponent only depend on the de Broglie length and a geometric length-scale, thus establishing the scale at which quantum effects become relevant. Then, we focus on the bound on the Lyapunov exponent and identify three different ways in which quantum effects arise in practice. We illustrate our findings on a toy model given by the surface of constant negative curvature - a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos - glued to a cylinder. By exact solution and numerical investigations, we show how the chaotic behaviour is limited by the quantum effects of the curvature itself. Interestingly, we find that at the lowest energies the bound to chaos is dominated by the longest length scales, and it is therefore a collective effect.",2021-06-24 18:42:23+00:00,10.21468/SciPostPhys.13.1.006

Measuring the dynamic charge response of the copper-oxides, $\chi''(q,\omega)$, would directly reveal the collective properties of the strange metal, but it has never been possible to measure this quantity with meV resolution. Here, we present the first measurement of $\chi''(q,\omega)$ for a cuprate, optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ ($T_c=91$ K), using momentum-resolved inelastic electron scattering. In the medium energy range 0.1-2 eV relevant to the strange metal, the spectra are dominated by a featureless, temperature- and momentum-independent continuum persisting to the eV energy scale. This continuum displays a simple power law form, exhibiting $q^2$ behavior at low energy and $q^2/\omega^2$ behavior at high energy. Measurements of an overdoped crystal ($T_c=50$ K) showed the emergence of a gap-like feature at low temperature, indicating deviation from power law form outside the strange metal regime. Our study suggests the strange metal exhibits a new type of charge dynamics in which excitations are local to such a degree that space and time axes are decoupled.",2017-08-06 19:49:02+00:00,10.1073/pnas.1721495115

Our goal is to characterize the conformal field theory (CFT) describing the universality class of the corresponding quantum phase transition. As a means to this end, we propose and demonstrate automated procedures which, using only the lattice Hamiltonian $H = \sum_j h_j$ as an input, systematically identify the low-energy eigenstates corresponding to Virasoro primary and quasiprimary operators, and assign the remaining low-energy eigenstates to conformal towers. The energies and momenta of the primary operator states are needed to determine the primary operator scaling dimensions and conformal spins -- an essential part of the conformal data that specifies the CFT. Our techniques use the action, on the low-energy eigenstates of $H$, of the Fourier modes $H_n$ of the Hamiltonian density $h_j$. The $H_n$ were introduced as lattice representations of the Virasoro generators by Koo and Saleur [Nucl. Phys. B 426, 459 (1994)].

Identifying the origin of these collective anomalies has proved profoundly challenging, even in materials such as the hole-doped cuprates that possess a simple band structure. The prevailing dogma is that strange metallicity in the cuprates is tied to a quantum critical point at a doping $p*$ inside the superconducting dome. Here, we study the high-field in-plane magnetoresistance of two superconducting cuprate families at doping levels beyond $p*$. At all dopings, the magnetoresistance exhibits quadrature scaling and becomes linear at high $H/T$ ratios. Moreover, its magnitude is found to be much larger than predicted by conventional theory and insensitive to both impurity scattering and magnetic field orientation. These observations, coupled with analysis of the zero-field and Hall resistivities, suggest that despite having a single band, the cuprate strange metal phase hosts two charge sectors, one containing coherent quasiparticles, the other scale-invariant `Planckian' dissipators.",2020-12-02 13:45:07+00:00,10.1038/s41586-021-03622-z

In this work, we study the dynamical process of the spontaneous scalarization of charged black hole in asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar models. Including various non-minimal couplings between the scalar field and Maxwell field, we observe that an initial scalar-free configuration suffers tachyonic instability and both the scalar field and the black hole irreducible mass grow exponentially at early times and saturate exponentially at late times. For fractional couplings, we find that though there is negative energy distribution near the black hole horizon, the black hole horizon area never decreases. But when the parameters are large, the evolution endpoints of linearly unstable bald black holes will be spacetimes with naked singularity and the cosmic censorship is violated. The effects of the black hole charge, cosmological constant and coupling strength on the dynamical scalarization process are studied in detail. We find that large enough cosmological constant can prevent the spontaneous scalarization.",2022-06-12 08:06:18+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevD.106.064036

Furthermore, we show that, if a perturbation exits the light-cone, and its intensity changes with time, due to dissipation, then there are always two observers that disagree on the stability of the state. Hence, ''stability'' is a Lorentz-invariant property of dissipative theories if and only if the principle of causality is respected.

Strong correlations in metals are often associated with their proximity to a Mott transition to an insulator created by the local Coulomb repulsion between the electrons. We explore the phase diagrams of a number of models of such local electronic correlation, employing a dynamical mean field theory in the presence of random spin exchange interactions. Numerical analyses and analytical solutions, using renormalization group methods and expansions in large spin degeneracy, lead to critical regions which display SYK physics.

In the first part, ETH is introduced as a natural extension of ideas from quantum chaos and random matrix theory (RMT). To this end, we present a brief overview of classical and quantum chaos, as well as RMT and some of its most important predictions. The latter include the statistics of energy levels, eigenstate components, and matrix elements of observables. Building on these, we introduce the ETH and show that it allows one to describe thermalization in isolated chaotic systems without invoking the notion of an external bath. We examine numerical evidence of eigenstate thermalization from studies of many-body lattice systems. We also introduce the concept of a quench as a means of taking isolated systems out of equilibrium, and discuss results of numerical experiments on quantum quenches. The second part of the review explores the implications of quantum chaos and ETH to thermodynamics. Basic thermodynamic relations are derived, including the second law of thermodynamics, the fundamental thermodynamic relation, fluctuation theorems, and the Einstein and Onsager relations. In particular, it is shown that quantum chaos allows one to prove these relations for individual Hamiltonian eigenstates and thus extend them to arbitrary stationary statistical ensembles. We then show how one can use these relations to obtain nontrivial universal energy distributions in continuously driven systems. At the end of the review, we briefly discuss the relaxation dynamics and description after relaxation of integrable quantum systems, for which ETH is violated. We introduce the concept of the generalized Gibbs ensemble, and discuss its connection with ideas of prethermalization in weakly interacting systems.",2015-09-21 21:52:33+00:00,10.1080/00018732.2016.1198134

First, we address the issue of gauge-fixing by borrowing from the Ricci-flow literature the so-called DeTurck trick, which renders the Einstein equation strictly elliptic and generalizes the usual harmonic-coordinate gauge. We then study two algorithms, Ricci-flow and Newton's method, for solving the resulting Einstein-DeTurck equation. We illustrate the use of these methods by studying localized black holes and non-uniform black strings in five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory, improving on previous calculations of their thermodynamic and geometric properties. We study spectra of various operators for these solutions, in particular finding negative modes of the Lichnerowicz operator. We classify the localized solutions into two branches that meet at a minimum temperature. We find good evidence for a merger between the localized and non-uniform solutions. We also find a narrow window of localized solutions that possess negative modes yet appear to have positive specific heat.",2009-05-12 12:29:25+00:00,10.1088/0264-9381/27/3/035002

2212.11829,Aspects of Conformal Field Theory,Matteo Broccoli,hep-th,hep-th gr-qc,"In this thesis we analyse three aspects of Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). First, we consider correlation functions of descendant states in two-dimensional CFTs. We discuss a recursive formula to calculate them and provide a computer implementation of it. This allows us to obtain any correlation function of vacuum descendants, and for non-vacuum descendants to express the correlator as a differential operator acting on the respective primary correlator. With this code, we study some entanglement and distinguishability measures between descendant states, i.e. the R\'enyi entropy, trace square distance and sandwiched R\'enyi divergence. With our results we can test the R\'enyi Quantum Null Energy Condition and provide new tools to analyse the holographic description of descendant states. Second, we study four-dimensional Weyl fermions on different backgrounds. Our interest is in their trace anomaly, where the Pontryagin density has been claimed to appear. To ascertain this possibility, we compute the anomalies of Dirac fermions coupled to vector and axial non-abelian gauge fields and then in a metric-axial-tensor background. Appropriate limits of the backgrounds allow to recover the anomalies of Weyl fermions coupled to non-abelian gauge fields and in a curved spacetime. In both cases we confirm the absence of the Pontryagin density in the trace anomalies. Third, we provide the holographic description of a four-dimensional CFT with an irrelevant operator. When the operator has integer conformal dimension, its presence in the CFT modifies the Weyl transformation of the metric, which in turns modifies the trace anomaly. Exploiting the equivalence between bulk diffeomorphisms and boundary Weyl transformations, we compute these modifications from the dual gravity theory. Our results represent an additional test of the AdS/CFT conjecture.",2022-12-22 16:09:18+00:00,10.18452/25593

When the cosmological constant is negative, we show that (in almost all cases) tidal forces diverge as one crosses the horizon, and this singularity is stronger for larger black holes. In particular, this applies to generic nonspherical black holes, such as those satisfying inhomogeneous boundary conditions. Nevertheless, all scalar curvature invariants remain finite. Moreover, we show that nonextremal black holes have tidal forces that diverge in the extremal limit. Holographically, this singularity is reflected in anomalous scaling of the specific heat with temperature. Similar (albeit weaker) effects are present when the cosmological constant is positive, but not when it vanishes.",2022-10-05 18:00:07+00:00,10.1007/JHEP01(2023)162

A bulk black hole whose horizon intersects the brane yields the classical bulk dual of a black hole coupled to quantum conformal fields. The evaporation of this black hole happens when the bulk horizon slides off the brane, making the horizon on the brane shrink. We use a large-D effective theory of the bulk Einstein equations to solve the time evolution of these systems. With this method, we study the dual evaporation of a variety of black holes interacting with colder radiation baths. We also obtain the dual of the collapse of holographic radiation to form a black hole on the brane. Finally, we discuss the evolution of the Page curve of the radiation in our evaporation setups, with entanglement islands appearing and then shrinking during the decreasing part of the curve.",2023-01-06 16:34:28+00:00,10.1007/JHEP05(2023)182

We first compute the metric up to a conformal factor with the lightcone cuts method introduced by Engelhardt and Horowitz. While a general prescription to determine the conformal factor is not known, we recover the factor by identifying the causal information surfaces from the lightcone cuts and finding that they are minimal. In addition, we propose a new type of kinematic space as the space of minimal surfaces in AdS$_{d+1}$, where a metric is introduced as a generalization of the case of $d=2$. This metric defines the set of bulk points, which is equivalent to that of lightcone cuts.

The incoherent bosons dominate the transport properties for the resistivity and optical conductivity in the non-Fermi liquid phase. Within the Kubo formalism, the resistivity is approximately linear in temperature with a Drude form for the optical conductivity, such that the Drude lifetime is inversely proportional to the temperature. Additionally, when the bosons emerge from electron pairs with spin-triplet symmetry, the magnetoresistance has a linear magnetic field dependence. Here, we compute the transport properties of such bosons within the memory-matrix approach that successfully captures the hydrodynamic regime. This technique emerges as the appropriate framework for describing the transport coefficients of the strange metal phase. Our analysis confirms the $T$-linear resistivity due to the Umklapp scattering that we obtained for this effective model. Finally, we provide new predictions regarding the variation of the thermal conductivity with temperature and examine the validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law.",2023-01-17 19:00:04+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevB.107.245109

They represent special quantum spaces and are thus strongly related to noncommutative geometry. In order to establish a semiclassical limit that allows to extract their intuitive geometrical content, this thesis analyzes and refines an approach that associates a classical geometry to a given matrix configuration, based on quasi-coherent states. While, so far, the approach is only well understood for very specific cases, in this work it is reviewed and implemented on a computer, allowing the numerical investigation of deformations of these cases. It is proven that the classical space can be made into a smooth manifold immersed into complex projective space. Further, the necessity for the consideration of foliations thereof is shown in order to deal with the observed and subsequently described phenomenon called oxidation. The developed numerical methods allow the visualization of the semiclassical limit as well as quantitative calculations. Explicit examples suggest the stability under perturbations of the refined approach and highlight the physical interpretation of the construction. All this supports a better understanding of the geometrical content of arbitrary matrix configurations as well as their classical interpretation and establishes the determination of important quantities.",2023-01-20 18:18:48+00:00,10.48550/2301.10206

The $SU(N)$ Gauss law of the theory enforces correlations between the matrix degrees of freedom associated to a geometric subregion and their complement. We call this `Gauss law entanglement'. We show that the subregion degrees of freedom transform under a single dominant, low rank representation of $SU(N)$. The corresponding Gauss law entanglement entropy is given by the logarithm of the dimension of this dominant representation. It is found that, after coarse-graining in momentum space, the $SU(N)$ Gauss law entanglement entropy is proportional to the geometric area bounding the subregion.

We highlight the unique characteristics of these concepts that arise from their quantum mechanical foundations and emphasize the differences from their classical counterparts. However, we also demonstrate that for Gaussian states, classical analogs can be used to obtain the same mathematical results, providing a valuable tool for simplifying calculations. To establish the groundwork for the subsequent analysis, we introduce some fundamental ideas from quantum field theory. We then explore the structure of parameter space using the fidelity and the Quantum Geometric Tensor (QGT), which is composed of the Quantum Metric Tensor and the Berry curvature. We also introduce the Quantum Covariance Matrix (QCM) and show its relationship to the QGT. We present how the QCM can be used to study entanglement between quantum systems by obtaining the purity, linear entropy, and von Neumann entropy. To illustrate these concepts, we calculate all these quantities for several systems, including the Stern-Gerlach, a two qubits system, two symmetrically coupled harmonic oscillators, and N coupled harmonic oscillators. In the final section of this thesis, we examine how the aforementioned quantum concepts can be applied in a classical sense, following the approach taken by Hannay with the Berry phase. We examine classical analogs of the QGT and QCM and since for Gaussian states, all the necessary information to calculate purity, linear entropy, and von Neumann entropy is contained within the QCM, we also generate classical analogs for them.

An adiabatic evolution is employed to transfer the well-known Pauli restrictions for identical, independent particles with two spin values to restrictions on the collective modes of an ensemble of ``spin up'' ``spin down'' particles. The collective modes, analytic N-body normal modes, are obtained from a group theoretic exact solution of the first-order equations. Cooper pairing is reinterpreted not as the pairing of two fermions with total zero momentum, but as the convergence of the momentum of the entire ensemble to two values, +k and -k, as the particles in the normal mode move back and forth with a single frequency and phase. The Fermi sea and Pauli blocking, commonly described using independent fermions that occupy lower states to create a ``sea'' in energy space and block occupation is redescribed as a collective energy phenomena of the entire ensemble. Superfluidity, which has always been viewed as a collective phenomena as Cooper pairs are assumed to condense into a macroscopic occupation of a single lowest state, is now reimagined without two-body pairing in real space, but as a macroscopic occupation of a low-energy phonon normal mode resulting in the convergence of the momentum to two equal and opposite values. The expected properties of superfluidity including the rigidity of the wave function, interactions between fermions in different pairs, convergence of the momentum and the gap in the excitation spectrum are discussed.",2023-04-10 16:18:37+00:00,10.48550/2304.04696

For the sake of completeness, we begin with the classical treatment of one-dimensional Brownian motion, discussing correlation functions and fluctuation-dissipation relations. The equation-of-motion approach, based on the Langevin equation, is mostly followed throughout the paper. A microscopic derivation of the generalized Langevin equation is outlined, based on the microscopic model of a heat bath as a collection of a large number of independent classical harmonic oscillators. We then consider a fully quantum-mechanical treatment of Brownian motion based on the quantum Langevin equation, where the bath is modelled as a collection of independent quantum harmonic oscillators. In the stationary state, we analyze the quantum counterpart of energy equipartition theorem, which has generated a considerable amount of interest in recent literature. The free energy, entropy and third law of thermodynamics are discussed for the one-dimensional quantum Brownian motion in a harmonic well. Following this, we explore some aspects of dissipative diamagnetism in the context of two-dimensional quantum Brownian motion. The role of an external magnetic field and confining potentials is discussed. We then briefly outline the path-integral approach to thermodynamics of a quantum Brownian particle. Finally, we devote a substantial part of the review to discussing stochastic thermodynamics and fluctuation theorems in the context of classical and quantum Langevin equation.",2023-06-05 07:59:35+00:00,10.48550/2306.02665

For static black holes analytically continued to Riemannian manifolds without boundary at the horizon this equation has previously been shown to be elliptic, and Ricci flow and Newton's method provide good numerical algorithms to solve it. Here we extend these techniques to the arbitrary cohomogeneity stationary case which must be treated in Lorentzian signature. For stationary spacetimes with globally timelike Killing vector the Harmonic Einstein equation is elliptic. In the presence of horizons and ergo-regions it is less obviously so. Motivated by the Rigidity theorem we study a class of stationary black hole spacetimes, considered previously by Harmark, general enough to include the asymptotically flat case in higher dimensions. We argue the Harmonic Einstein equation consistently truncates to this class of spacetimes giving an elliptic problem. The Killing horizons and axes of rotational symmetry are boundaries for this problem and we determine boundary conditions there. As a simple example we numerically construct 4D rotating black holes in a cavity using Anderson's boundary conditions.

We examine the linearised perturbations about the solutions that are associated with the thermoelectric DC conductivity. We show that there is a decoupled sector at the black hole horizon which must solve generalised Stokes equations for a charged fluid. By solving these equations we can obtain the DC conductivity of the dual field theory. For Q-lattices and one-dimensional lattices we solve the fluid equations to obtain closed form expressions for the DC conductivity in terms of the solution at the black hole horizon. We also determine the leading order DC conductivity for lattices that can be expanded as a perturbative series about translationally invariant solutions.,2015-07-01 13:51:59+00:00,10.48550/1507.00234

We also obtain the relevant Stokes equations for bulk theories of gravity in four dimensions including a $\vartheta F\wedge F$ term in the Lagrangian, where $\vartheta$ is a function of dynamical scalar fields.

Independent calculations via Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton holography and memory matrix methods lead to the same results. We show that random field disorder has a strong effect on resistivity: charge carriers in the infrared are easily depleted, as the relaxation time for momentum is surprisingly small. In the course of our holographic calculation we use a non-trivial dilaton coupling to the disordered scalar, allowing us to study a strongly-coupled scale invariant theory with $\theta \ne 0$. Using holography, we are also able to determine the disorder strength at which perturbation theory breaks down.

To this model, we add a $U(1)$ charged scalar and show that below a critical temperature, it forms a spatially homogeneous condensate that restores isotropy in a new superconducting ground state. We determine the phase diagram in terms of the helix parameters and perform a stability analysis on its IR fixed point corresponding to a finite density condensed phase at zero temperature. Moreover, by analyzing fluctuations about the gravity background, we study the optical conductivity. Due to the lattice, this model provides an example for a holographic insulator-superfluid transition in which there is no unrealistic delta-function peak in the normal phase DC conductivity. Our results suggest that in the zero temperature limit, all degrees of freedom present in the normal phase condense. This, together with the breaking of translation invariance, has implications for Homes' and Uemuras's relations. This is of relevance for applications to real world condensed matter systems.

We furthermore identify signatures of fluctuating density waves in frequency and spatially resolved conductivities. Phase disordering is well known to lead to a large viscosity.

We use this formalism to compute transport coefficients in the Dirac fluid in clean samples of graphene near the charge neutrality point, and find results insensitive to long range Coulomb interactions. Numerical results are compared to recent experimental data on thermal and electrical conductivity in the Dirac fluid in graphene and substantially improved quantitative agreement over existing hydrodynamic theories is found.

Here, using gauge-gravity duality, we present the low temperature dependence of thermodynamic and charge transport coefficients at first order in the hydrodynamic derivative expansion in terms of the critical exponents. Special attention will be paid to the behavior of the charge density of the normal flow in systems with emergent infrared conformal and Lifshitz symmetries, parameterized by a Lifshitz dynamical exponent $z>1$. When $1\leq z<d+2$, we recover ($z=1$) and extend ($z>1$) previous results obtained by relativistic effective field theory techniques. Instead, when $z>d+2$, we show that the normal charge density becomes non-vanishing at zero temperature.

Upon breaking translations spontaneously, new gapless collective modes emerge, the Nambu-Goldstone bosons of broken translations. When translations are also weakly broken (eg by disorder or lattice effects), these phonons are pinned with a mass $m$ and damped at a rate $\Omega$, which we explicitly compute. This contribution to $\Omega$ is distinct from that of topological defects. We show that $\Omega\simeq G m^2\Xi$, where $G$ is the shear modulus and $\Xi$ is related to a diffusivity of the purely spontaneous state. This result follows from the smallness of the bulk and shear moduli, as would be the case in a phase with fluctuating translational order. At low temperatures, the collective modes relax quickly into the heat current, so that late time transport is dominated by the thermal diffusivity. In this regime, the resistivity in our model is linear in temperature and the ac conductivity displays a significant rearranging of the degrees of freedom, as spectral weight is shifted from an off-axis, pinning peak to a Drude-like peak. These results could shed light on transport properties in cuprate high $T_c$ superconductors, where quantum critical behavior and translational order occur over large parts of the phase diagram and transport shows qualitatively similar features.",2018-12-19 17:56:07+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.211602

In the sound channel it is set by a pole-pole collision on a non-principal sheet of the Green's function.

The dynamics of such theories depends only on the dimensionless ratio $V/k$, and we expect that they flow in the infrared to new CFTs whose universality class changes as a function of $V/k$. We compute the frequency-dependent conductivity of strongly-coupled CFTs using holography of the Einstein-Maxwell theory in 4-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. We compare the results with the corresponding computation of weakly-coupled CFTs, perturbed away from the CFT of free, massless Dirac fermions (which describes graphene at low energies). We find that the results of the two computations have significant qualitative similarities. However, differences do appear in the vicinities of an infinite discrete set of values of $V/k$: the universality class of the infrared CFT changes at these values in the weakly-coupled theory, by the emergence of new zero modes of Dirac fermions which are remnants of local Fermi surfaces. The infrared theory changes continuously in holography, and the classical gravitational theory does not capture the physics of the discrete transition points between the infrared CFTs.

The growth rate of this density-dependent operator size vanishes algebraically with charge density; hence we obtain new bounds on Lyapunov exponents and butterfly velocities in charged systems at a given density, which are parametrically stronger than any Lieb-Robinson bound. We argue that the density dependence of our bound on the Lyapunov exponent is saturated in the charged Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.

We verify numerically that, in holographic systems with momentum dissipation, the viscosity to entropy bound might be violated but the shear diffusion constant remains bounded by below. This confirms the idea that $\eta/s$ loses its privileged role in non-relativistic systems and that, in order to find more universal bounds, one should rather look at diffusion constants. We strengthen this idea by showing that, in presence of spontaneously broken translations, the Goldstone diffusion constant satisfies a universal lower bound in terms of the Planckian relaxation time and the butterfly velocity. Additionally, all the diffusive processes in the model satisfy an upper bound, imposed by causality, which is given in terms of the thermalization time -- the imaginary part of the first non-hydrodynamic mode in the spectrum -- and the speed of longitudinal sound. Finally, we discuss the existence of a bound on the speed of sound in holographic conformal solids and we show that the conformal value acts as a lower (and not upper) bound on the speed of longitudinal phonons. Nevertheless, we show that the stiffness $\partial p/\partial \epsilon$ is still bounded by above by its conformal value. This suggests that the bounds conjectured in the past have to be considered on the stiffness of the system, related to its equation of state, and not on the propagation speed of sound.",2020-05-13 18:00:03+00:00,10.21468/SciPostPhys.9.1.007

1304.4249,Non-Fermi liquids and the Wiedemann-Franz law,Raghu Mahajan ; Maissam Barkeshli ; Sean A. Hartnoll,cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.str-el hep-th,"A general discussion of the ratio of thermal and electrical conductivities in non-Fermi liquid metals is given. In metals with sharp Drude peaks, the relevant physics is correctly organized around the slow relaxation of almost-conserved momenta. While in Fermi liquids both currents and momenta relax slowly, due to the weakness of interactions among low energy excitations, in strongly interacting non-Fermi liquids typically only momenta relax slowly. It follows that the conductivities of such non-Fermi liquids are obtained within a fundamentally different kinematics to Fermi liquids. Among these strongly interacting non-Fermi liquids we distinguish cases with only one almost-conserved momentum, which we term hydrodynamic metals, and with many patchwise almost-conserved momenta. For all these cases, we obtain universal expressions for the ratio of conductivities that violate the Wiedemann-Franz law. We further discuss the case in which long-lived `cold' quasiparticles, in general with unconventional scattering rates, coexist with strongly interacting hot spots, lines or bands. For these cases, we characterize circumstances under which non-Fermi liquid transport, in particular a linear in temperature resistivity, is and is not compatible with the Wiedemann-Franz law.

Joshi ; Subir Sachdev ; Maria Tikhanovskaya,cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.str-el hep-th,"We investigate a model of electrons with random and all-to-all hopping and spin exchange interactions, with a constraint of no double occupancy. The model is studied in a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev-like large-$M$ limit with SU($M$) spin symmetry. The saddle point equations of this model are similar to appoximate dynamic mean field equations of realistic, non-random, $t$-$J$ models. We use numerical studies on both real and imaginary frequency axes, along with asymptotic analyses, to establish the existence of a critical non-Fermi-liquid metallic ground state at large doping, with the spin correlation exponent varying with doping. This critical solution possesses a time-reparametrization symmetry, akin to SYK models, which contributes a linear-in-temperature resistivity over the full range of doping where the solution is present. It is therefore an attractive mean-field description of the overdoped region of cuprates, where experiments have observed a linear-$T$ resistivity in a broad region. The critical metal also displays a strong particle-hole asymmetry, which is relevant to Seebeck coefficient measurements. We show that the critical metal has an instability to a low-doping spin-glass phase, and compute a critical doping value.

Scalettar,cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.str-el quant-ph,"The ""sign problem"" (SP) is the fundamental limitation to simulations of strongly correlated materials in condensed matter physics, solving quantum chromodynamics at finite baryon density, and computational studies of nuclear matter. As a result, it is part of the reason fields such as ultra-cold atomic physics are so exciting: they can provide quantum emulators of models that could not otherwise be solved, due to the SP. For the same reason, it is also one of the primary motivations behind quantum computation. It is often argued that the SP is not intrinsic to the physics of particular Hamiltonians, since the details of how it onsets, and its eventual occurrence, can be altered by the choice of algorithm or many-particle basis. Despite that, we show that the SP in determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) is quantitatively linked to quantum critical behavior. We demonstrate this via simulations of a number of fundamental models of condensed matter physics, including the spinful and spinless Hubbard Hamiltonians on a honeycomb lattice and the ionic Hubbard Hamiltonian, all of whose critical properties are relatively well understood. We then propose a reinterpretation of the low average sign for the Hubbard model on the square lattice when away from half-filling, an important open problem in condensed matter physics, in terms of the onset of pseudogap behavior and exotic superconductivity. Our study charts a path for exploiting the average sign in QMC simulations to understand quantum critical behavior, rather than solely as an obstacle that prevents quantum simulations of many-body Hamiltonians at low temperature.",2021-08-20 02:42:58+00:00,10.1126/science.abg9299

The mysterious strange metal is characterized by non-Boltzmann transport and violates most fundamental Fermi liquid scaling laws. A fundamental question is: Do strange metals have plasmons? Using momentum-resolved inelastic electron scattering (M-EELS) we recently showed that, rather than a plasmon, optimally-doped Bi$_{2.1}$Sr$_{1.9}$Ca$_{1.0}$Cu$_{2.0}$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212) exhibits a featureless, temperature-independent continuum with a power-law form over most energy and momentum scales [M. Mitrano, PNAS 115, 5392-5396 (2018)]. Here, we show that this continuum is present throughout the fan-shaped, strange metal region of the phase diagram. Outside this region, dramatic changes in spectral weight are observed: In underdoped samples, spectral weight up to 0.5 eV is enhanced at low temperature, biasing the system towards a charge order instability. The situation is reversed in the overdoped case, where spectral weight is strongly suppressed at low temperature, increasing quasiparticle coherence in this regime. Optimal doping corresponds to the boundary between these two opposite behaviors at which the response is temperature-independent. Our study suggests that plasmons do not exist as well-defined excitations in Bi-2212, and that a featureless continuum is a defining property of the strange metal, which is connected to a peculiar crossover where the spectral weight change undergoes a sign reversal.",2019-03-10 18:32:54+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevX.9.041062

Detected originally through high magnetic field, transport experiments, signatures of this phase have now been uncovered with a variety of probes. Our high resolution optical data of the low T$_{c}$ cuprate superconductor, Bi$_{2-x}$Pb$_{x}$Sr$_{2-y}$La$_{y}$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ allows us to probe this phase over a large energy and temperature window. We demonstrate that the optical signatures of the strange metal phase persist throughout the phase diagram. The strange metal signatures in the optical conductivity are two-fold, (i): a low energy Drude response with Drude width on the order of temperature and (ii): a high energy conformal tail with doping dependent power-law exponent. While the Drude weight evolves monotonously throughout the entire doping range studied, the spectral weight contained in the high energy conformal tail appears to be doping and temperature independent. Our analysis further shows that the temperature dependence of the optical conductivity is completely determined by the Drude parameters. Our results indicate that there is no critical doping level inside the superconducting dome where the carrier density starts to change drastically and that the previously observed 'return to normalcy' is a consequence of the increasing importance of the Drude component relative to the conformal tail with doping. Importantly, both the doping and temperature dependence of the resistivity are largely determined by the Drude width.",2022-05-02 13:21:52+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevB.106.054515

Gentle ; Blaise Goutéraux,hep-th,hep-th cond-mat.str-el,"The dissipative dynamics of strongly interacting systems are often characterised by the timescale set by the inverse temperature $\tau_P\sim\hbar/(k_BT)$. We show that near a class of strongly interacting quantum critical points that arise in the infra-red limit of translationally invariant holographic theories, there is a collective excitation (a quasinormal mode of the dual black hole spacetime) whose lifetime $\tau_{eq}$ is parametrically longer than $\tau_P$: $\tau_{eq}\gg T^{-1}$. The lifetime is enhanced due to its dependence on a dangerously irrelevant coupling that breaks the particle-hole symmetry and the invariance under Lorentz boosts of the quantum critical point. The thermal diffusivity (in units of the butterfly velocity) is anomalously large near the quantum critical point and is governed by $\tau_{eq}$ rather than $\tau_P$. We conjecture that there exists a long-lived, propagating collective mode with velocity $v_s$, and in this case the relation $D=v_s^2\tau_{eq}$ holds exactly in the limit $T\tau_{eq}\gg1$. While scale invariance is broken, a generalised scaling theory still holds provided that the dependence of observables on the dangerously irrelevant coupling is incorporated.

In contrast, we will show that in strongly entangled strange metals the protection of zero sound fails at finite frequency and plasmons are always short lived regardless of their wavelength.

In this work, we provide the first real-space imaging of Poiseuille flow of an electronic fluid, as well as visualization of its evolution from ballistic flow. Utilizing a scanning nanotube single electron transistor, we image the Hall voltage of electronic flow through channels of high-mobility graphene. We find that the profile of the Hall field across the channel is a key physical quantity for distinguishing ballistic from hydrodynamic flow. We image the transition from flat, ballistic field profiles at low temperature into parabolic field profiles at elevated temperatures, which is the hallmark of Poiseuille flow. The curvature of the imaged profiles is qualitatively reproduced by Boltzmann calculations, which allow us to create a 'phase diagram' that characterizes the electron flow regimes.

In this paper we propose that the butterfly velocity can be used to diagnose quantum phase transition (QPT) in holographic theories. We provide evidences for this proposal with an anisotropic holographic model exhibiting metal-insulator transitions (MIT), in which the derivatives of the butterfly velocity with respect to system parameters characterizes quantum critical points (QCP) with local extremes in zero temperature limit.

Starinets ; Petar Tadić,hep-th,hep-th cond-mat.str-el nucl-th,"By using holographic methods, the radii of convergence of the hydrodynamic shear and sound dispersion relations were previously computed in the ${\cal N} = 4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at infinite 't Hooft coupling and infinite number of colours. Here, we extend this analysis to the domain of large but finite 't Hooft coupling. To leading order in the perturbative expansion, we find that the radii grow with increasing inverse coupling, contrary to naive expectations. However, when the equations of motion are solved using a qualitative non-perturbative resummation, the dependence on the coupling becomes piecewise continuous and the initial growth is followed by a decrease. The piecewise nature of the dependence is related to the dynamics of branch point singularities of the energy-momentum tensor finite-temperature two-point functions in the complex plane of spatial momentum squared. We repeat the study using the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity as a model where the equations can be solved fully non-perturbatively, and find the expected decrease of the radii of convergence with the effective inverse coupling which is also piecewise continuous. Finally, we provide arguments in favour of the non-perturbative approach and show that the presence of non-perturbative modes in the quasinormal spectrum can be indirectly inferred from the analysis of perturbative critical points.",2021-04-22 13:07:58+00:00,10.1007/JHEP06(2021)180

We obtain a number of model independent results, including the long-time tail of the bulk stress correlation function, and the leading non-analyticity of the spectral function at small frequency. We also establish a lower bound on the bulk viscosity which is weakly dependent on assumptions regarding the range of applicability of fluid dynamics. The bound on the bulk viscosity $\zeta$ scales as $\zeta_{\it min} \sim (P-\frac{2}{3}{\cal E})^2 \sum_i D_i^{-2}$, where $D_i$ are the diffusion constants for energy and momentum, and $P-\frac{2}{3}{\cal E}$, where $P$ is the pressure and ${\cal E}$ is the energy density, is a measure of scale breaking. Applied to the cold Fermi gas near unitarity, $|\lambda/a_s|\geq 1$ where $\lambda$ is the thermal de Broglie wave length and $a_s$ is the $s$-wave scattering length, this bound implies that the ratio of bulk viscosity to entropy density satisfies $\zeta/s \geq 0.1\hbar/k_B$.

Thermal fluctuations in these waves can lead to the diffusion of momentum density, contributing to the shear viscosity and other transport coefficients. Within viscous hydrodynamics in 3+1 dimensions, this leads to a positive contribution to the shear viscosity, which is finite but inversely proportional to the microscopic shear viscosity. Therefore the effective infrared viscosity is bounded from below. The contribution to the second-order transport coefficient $\tau_\pi$ is divergent, which means that second-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics is inconsistent below some frequency scale. We estimate the importance of each effect for the Quark-Gluon Plasma, finding them to be minor if $\eta/s = 0.16$ but important if $\eta/s = 0.08$.",2011-04-08 14:36:40+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevD.84.025006

We further conjecture that for a many-body quantum system with a quantum phase transition, the Lyapunov exponent will have a peak in the quantum critical region where there exists an emergent conformal symmetry and is absent of well-defined quasi-particles.

On the other hand, experimentally, the linear-$T$ resistivity is observed in a large range of temperatures, up to room temperature.

We study a temperature regime in which the electrical resistivity of this system exceeds the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit and increases linearly with temperature - a sign that there are no long-lived charged quasiparticles - although the phonons remain well-defined quasiparticles. The long-lived phonons determine $\lambda_L$, rendering it parametrically smaller than the theoretical upper-bound $\lambda_L \ll \lambda_{max}=2\pi T/\hbar$.

In two spatial dimensions, the Lyapunov exponent is universally related at weak coupling to the sheet resistivity.

Several regions of the $(\gamma,\delta)$ plane can be excluded as the extremal solutions have unacceptable singularities. The classical solutions have generically zero entropy at zero temperature, except when $\gamma=\delta$ where the entropy at extremality is finite. The general scaling of DC resistivity with temperature at low temperature, and AC conductivity at low frequency and temperature across the whole $(\gamma,\delta)$ plane, is found. There is a codimension-one region where the DC resistivity is linear in the temperature. For massive carriers, it is shown that when the scalar operator is not the dilaton, the DC resistivity scales as the heat capacity (and entropy) for planar (3d) systems.

This black hole has two properties which one might reasonably demand of the dual of a Fermi liquid: Its entropy is proportional to temperature at low temperature, and its extremal limit supports normal modes of massless, charged bulk fermions. The black hole we study has a simple analytic form because it can be embedded in type IIB string theory as the near-horizon limit of D3-branes with equal spins in two of the three independent transverse planes. Two further properties can be deduced from this embedding: There is a thermodynamic instability, reminiscent of ferromagnetism, at low temperatures; and there is an AdS_3 factor in the extremal near-horizon geometry which accounts for the linear dependence of entropy on temperature. Altogether, it is plausible that the dilatonic black hole we study, or a relative of it with similar behavior in the infrared, is the dual of a Fermi liquid; however, the particular embedding in string theory that we consider is unlikely to have such a dual description, unless through some unexpected boson-fermion equivalence at large N.",2009-11-16 04:09:14+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevD.81.046001

1804.00665,Electronic hydrodynamics and the breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz and Mott laws in interacting metals,Andrew Lucas ; Sankar Das Sarma,cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.mes-hall,"We present the theory of thermoelectric transport in metals with long-lived quasiparticles, carefully addressing the interplay of electron-electron scattering as well as electron-impurity scattering, but neglecting electron-phonon scattering. In Fermi liquids with a large Fermi surface and weak electron-impurity scattering, we provide universal and simple formulas for the behavior of the thermoelectric conductivities across the ballistic-to-hydrodynamic crossover. In this regime, the electrical conductivity is relatively unchanged by hydrodynamic effects. In contrast, the thermal conductivity can be parametrically smaller than predicted by the Wiedemann-Franz law. A less severe violation of the Mott law arises. We quantitatively compare the violations of the Wiedemann-Franz law arising from (i) momentum-conserving electron-electron scattering in the collision integral, (ii) hydrodynamic modifications of the electron-impurity scattering rate, and (iii) thermal broadening of the Fermi surface, and show that (i) is the largest. We present simple formulas for electrical and thermal magnetoconductivity across the ballistic-to-hydrodynamic limit, along with a more complicated formula for the thermoelectric magnetoconductivity. In a finite magnetic field, the Lorenz number may be smaller or larger than predicted by the Wiedemann-Franz law, and the crossover between these behaviors is a clear prediction for experiments. The arbitrarily strong violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law found in our work arises entirely from electron-electron interaction effects within the Fermi liquid paradigm, and does not imply any non-Fermi liquid behavior. We predict clear experimental signatures of bulk hydrodynamics in high-mobility 2D GaAs semiconductor structures, where failure of the Wiedemann-Franz law should persist down to very low temperatures in high-quality, low-density samples.",2018-04-02 18:00:01+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevB.97.245128

For this purpose, we analyze, in detail, not only the holographic axion model, but also the magnetically charged black holes with two methods: the near-horizon analysis and quasi-normal mode computations. We find that the pole-skipping points are related with the chaotic properties, Lyapunov exponent ($\lambda_L$) and butterfly velocity ($v_B$), independently of the symmetry breaking patterns. We show that the diffusion constant ($D$) is bounded by $D \,\geqslant\, v_{B}^2/\lambda_{L}$, where $D$ is the energy diffusion (crystal diffusion) bound for explicit (spontaneous) symmetry breaking.

Nielsen,quant-ph,quant-ph,"Determining the quantum circuit complexity of a unitary operation is closely related to the problem of finding minimal length paths in a particular curved geometry [Nielsen et al, Science 311, 1133-1135 (2006)]. This paper investigates many of the basic geometric objects associated to this space, including the Levi-Civita connection, the geodesic equation, the curvature, and the Jacobi equation. We show that the optimal Hamiltonian evolution for synthesis of a desired unitary necessarily obeys a simple universal geodesic equation. As a consequence, once the initial value of the Hamiltonian is set, subsequent changes to the Hamiltonian are completely determined by the geodesic equation. We develop many analytic solutions to the geodesic equation, and a set of invariants that completely determine the geodesics. We investigate the problem of finding minimal geodesics through a desired unitary, U, and develop a procedure which allows us to deform the (known) geodesics of a simple and well understood metric to the geodesics of the metric of interest in quantum computation. This deformation procedure is illustrated using some three-qubit numerical examples. We study the computational complexity of evaluating distances on Riemmanian manifolds, and show that no efficient classical algorithm for this problem exists, subject to the assumption that good pseudorandom generators exist. Finally, we develop a canonical extension procedure for unitary operations which allows ancilla qubits to be incorporated into the geometric approach to quantum computing.",2006-12-31 05:17:13+00:00,10.48550/quant-ph/0701004
1709.10184,On the Time Dependence of Holographic Complexity,Dean Carmi ; Shira Chapman ; Hugo Marrochio ; Robert C. Myers ; Sotaro Sugishita,hep-th,hep-th gr-qc quant-ph,"We evaluate the full time dependence of holographic complexity in various eternal black hole backgrounds using both the complexity=action (CA) and the complexity=volume (CV) conjectures. We conclude using the CV conjecture that the rate of change of complexity is a monotonically increasing function of time, which saturates from below to a positive constant in the late time limit. Using the CA conjecture for uncharged black holes, the holographic complexity remains constant for an initial period, then briefly decreases but quickly begins to increase. As observed previously, at late times, the rate of growth of the complexity approaches a constant, which may be associated with Lloyd's bound on the rate of computation. However, we find that this late time limit is approached from above, thus violating the bound. Adding a charge to the eternal black holes washes out the early time behaviour, i.e., complexity immediately begins increasing with sufficient charge, but the late time behaviour is essentially the same as in the neutral case. We also evaluate the complexity of formation for charged black holes and find that it is divergent for extremal black holes, implying that the states at finite chemical potential and zero temperature are infinitely more complex than their finite temperature counterparts.",2017-09-28 22:04:34+00:00,10.1007/JHEP11(2017)188

Our system involves a dilaton $\phi$ coupled to a Maxwell field $F_{\mu\nu}$ with dilaton-dependent gauge coupling, ${1\over g^2} = f^2(\phi)$. First, we find the solutions for extremal and near extremal branes through a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. The near horizon geometries in the simplest cases, where $f(\phi) = e^{\alpha\phi}$, are Lifshitz-like, with a dynamical exponent $z$ determined by $\alpha$. The black hole thermodynamics varies in an interesting way with $\alpha$, but in all cases the entropy is vanishing and the specific heat is positive for the near extremal solutions. We then compute conductivity in these backgrounds. We find that somewhat surprisingly, the AC conductivity vanishes like $\omega^2$ at T=0 independent of $\alpha$. We also explore the charged black brane physics of several other classes of gauge-coupling functions $f(\phi)$. In addition to possible applications in AdS/CMT, the extremal black branes are of interest from the point of view of the attractor mechanism. The near horizon geometries for these branes are universal, independent of the asymptotic values of the moduli, and describe generic classes of endpoints for attractor flows which are different from $AdS_2\times R^2$.",2009-11-18 19:14:01+00:00,10.1007/JHEP08(2010)078

Inspired by simple constructions achieved for the case of disks and the half-plane, we reformulate bit threads in terms of a magnetic-like field generated by a current flowing through the boundary of the entangling region. The construction is possible for these highly symmetric settings, leading us to a modified Biot-Savart law in curved space that fully characterizes the entanglement structure of the state. For general entangling regions, the prescription breaks down as the corresponding modular Hamiltonians become inherently nonlocal. We develop a formalism for general shape deformations and derive a flow equation that accounts for these effects as a systematic expansion. We solve this equation for a complete set of small deformations and show that the structure of the expansion explicitly codifies the expected nonlocalities.

My real objective is to present an experimental strategy to test critically whether these principles are actually at work, revolving around the famous linear resistivity characterizing the strange metal phase. The theory suggests a very simple explanation of this ""unreasonably simple"" behavior that is actually directly linked to remarkable results from the study of the quark gluon plasma formed at the heavy ion colliders: the ""fast hydrodynamization"" and the ""minimal viscosity"". This leads to high quality predictions for experiment: the momentum relaxation rate governing the resistivity relates directly to the electronic entropy, while at low temperatures the electron fluid should become unviscous to a degree that turbulent flows can develop even on the nanometre scale.",2018-07-28 15:25:02+00:00,10.21468/SciPostPhys.6.5.061
1301.0537,Holography without translational symmetry,David Vegh,hep-th,hep-th cond-mat.str-el,"We propose massive gravity as a holographic framework for describing a class of strongly interacting quantum field theories with broken translational symmetry. Bulk gravitons are assumed to have a Lorentz-breaking mass term as a substitute for spatial inhomogeneities. This breaks momentum-conservation in the boundary field theory. At finite chemical potential, the gravity duals are charged black holes in asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime. The conductivity in these systems generally exhibits a Drude peak that approaches a delta function in the massless gravity limit. Furthermore, the optical conductivity shows an emergent scaling law: $|\sigma(\omega)| \approx {A \over \omega^{\alpha}} + B$. This result is consistent with that found earlier by Horowitz, Santos, and Tong who introduced an explicit inhomogeneous lattice into the system.",2013-01-03 20:11:12+00:00,10.48550/1301.0537

Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute the relaxation time scale as a function of the background magnetic field B and charge density \rho. The theory admits two different types of impurities. We find that for magnetic impurities, momentum relaxation due to the impurity is suppressed by a background B or \rho. For electric impurities, due to an underlying instability in the theory towards an ordered phase, the inverse relaxation time scale increases dramatically near \sqrt{B^2 + \rho^2/\sigma^2_0} \sim 21 T^2.

Lu ; Yi Pang,hep-th,hep-th gr-qc,"It was recently shown that charged AdS boson stars can reproduce the universal structure of the lowest scaling dimension in the subsector of a CFT with fixed large global $U(1)$ charge $Q$. Using the model consisting of Einstein-Maxwell gravity with a negative cosmological constant, coupled to a $U(1)$-charged conformally massless scalar with the fourth-order self interaction, we construct a class of charged AdS boson star solutions in the large $Q$ limit, where the scalar field obeys a mixed boundary condition, parameterized by $k$ that interpolates between the Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions corresponding to $k=0$ and $\infty$ respectively. By varying $k$, we numerically read off the $k$ dependence of the leading coefficient $c_{3/2}(k) \equiv \lim_{Q\rightarrow \infty} M/Q^{3/2}$. We find that $c_{3/2}(k)$ is a monotonously increasing function which grows linearly when $k$ is sufficiently small. When $k\rightarrow \infty$, $c_{3/2}(k)$ approaches the maximal value at a decreasing rate given by $k^{-3/2}$ . We also obtain a close form expression that fits the numerical data for the entire range of $k$ within $10^{-4}$ accuracy.",2020-12-31 19:00:01+00:00,10.1007/JHEP04(2021)220

Link ; Blaise Goutéraux ; Jörg Schmalian,cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.str-el hep-th quant-ph,"The transport behavior of strongly anisotropic systems is significantly richer compared to isotropic ones. The most dramatic spatial anisotropy at a critical point occurs at a Lifshitz transition, found in systems with merging Dirac or Weyl point or near the superconductor-insulator quantum phase transition. Previous work found that in these systems a famous conjecture on the existence of a lower bound for the ratio of a shear viscosity to entropy is violated, and proposed a generalization of this bound for anisotropic systems near charge neutrality involving the electric conductivities. The present study uses scaling arguments and the gauge-gravity duality to confirm the previous analysis of universal bounds in anisotropic Dirac systems. We investigate the strongly-coupled phase of quantum Lifshitz systems in a gravitational Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model with a linear massless scalar which breaks translations in the boundary dual field theory and sources the anisotropy. The holographic computation demonstrates that some elements of the viscosity tensor can be related to the ratio of the electric conductivities through a simple geometric ratio of elements of the bulk metric evaluated at the horizon, and thus obey a generalized bound, while others violate it. From the IR critical geometry, we express the charge diffusion constants in terms of the square butterfly velocities. The proportionality factor turns out to be direction-independent, linear in the inverse temperature, and related to the critical exponents which parametrize the anisotropic scaling of the dual field theory.",2019-07-12 13:51:31+00:00,10.1007/JHEP11(2020)088

Despite much circumstantial evidence, however, there is no known $\tau$ for which this bound is universal. Here we define operator size at finite temperature, and conjecture such a $\tau$: the time scale over which small operators become large. All known many-body theories are consistent with this conjecture. This proposed bound explains why previously conjectured Planckian bounds do not always apply to weakly coupled theories, and how Planckian time scales can be relevant to both transport and chaos.",2018-09-20 18:00:01+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.216601
1812.08164,Quantum Critical Diffusion and Thermodynamics in Lifshitz Holography,Brandon W. Langley ; Philip W. Phillips,hep-th,hep-th cond-mat.str-el,"We present the full charge and energy diffusion constants for the Einstein-Maxwell dilaton (EMD) action for Lifshitz spacetime characterized by a dynamical critical exponent $z$. Therein we compute the fully renormalized static thermodynamic potential explicitly, which confirms the forms of all thermodynamic quantities including the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and Smarr-like relationship. Our exact computation demonstrates a modification to the Lifshitz Ward identity for the EMD theory. For transport, we target our analysis at finite chemical potential and include axion fields to generate momentum dissipation. While our exact results corroborate anticipated bounds, we are able to demonstrate that the diffusivities are governed by the engineering dimension of the diffusion coefficient, $[D]=2-z$. Consequently, a $\beta$-function defined as the derivative of the trace of the diffusion matrix with respect to the effective lattice spacing changes sign precisely at $z=2$. At $z=2$, the diffusion equation exhibits perfect scale invariance and the corresponding diffusion constant is the pure number $1/d_s$ for both the charge and energy sectors, where $d_s$ is the number of spatial dimensions. Further, we find that as $z\to\infty$, the charge diffusion constant vanishes, indicating charge localization. Deviation from universal decoupled transport obtains when either the chemical potential or momentum dissipation are large relative to temperature, an echo of strong thermoelectric interactions.",2018-12-19 18:59:58+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevD.103.026016

We derive a simple expression for the variation of the free-energy with respect to changing the periods. This explains some observations, based on numerics, that have arisen in the explicit construction of thermodynamically preferred black holes in the case that the spatial directions are infinite in extent and the symmetry is spontaneously broken.

Beyond this regime, the heat transport must be understood in terms of incoherent motion of the atoms under strongly anharmonic interactions. In this work, we propose a model for heat transport in a strongly anharmonic system where the thermal diffusivity can be lower than the Planckian thermal diffusivity bound. Similar to the materials which exhibit thermal diffusivity close to this bound, our scenario involves complex unit cell with incoherent intra-cell dynamics. We derive a general formalism to compute thermal conductivity in such cases with anharmonic intra-cell dynamics coupled to nearly harmonic inter-cell coupling. Through direct numerical simulation of the non-linear unit cell motion, we explicitly show that our model allows sub-Planckian thermal diffusivity. We find that the propagator of the acoustic phonons becomes incoherent throughout most of the Brillouin zone in this limit. We expect these features to apply to more realistic models of complex insulators showing sub-Planckian thermal diffusivity, suggesting a multi-species generalization of the thermal diffusivity bound that is similar to the viscosity bound in fluids.",2021-01-13 21:27:02+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevB.103.184305

It exhibits a maximally chaotic behavior characterized by out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and is expected to be a holographic dual to black holes. Recently, a striking similarity between the SYK model and the Hund-coupling induced spin-freezing crossover in multi-orbital Hubbard models has been pointed out. To further explore this connection, we study OTOCs for fermionic Hubbard models, which are prototypical models for strongly correlated electrons in solids. We introduce an imaginary-time four-point correlation function with an appropriate time ordering, which by means of the spectral representation and the out-of-time-order fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be analytically continued to real-time OTOCs. Based on this approach, we numerically evaluate real-time OTOCs for Hubbard models in the thermodynamic limit, using the dynamical mean-field theory in combination with a numerically exact continuous-time Monte Carlo impurity solver. The results for the single-orbital model show that a certain spin-related OTOC captures local moment formation in the vicinity of the metal-insulator transition, while the self-energy does not show SYK-like non-Fermi liquid behavior. On the other hand, for the two- and three-orbital models with nonzero Hund coupling we find that the OTOC exhibits a rapid damping at short times and an approximate power-law decay at longer times in the spin-freezing crossover regime characterized by fluctuating local moments and a non-Fermi liquid self-energy $\Sigma(\omega) \sim \sqrt{\omega}$. These results are in a good agreement with the behavior of the SYK model, providing firm evidence for the close relation between the spin-freezing crossover physics of multi-orbital Hubbard models and the SYK strange metal.",2018-12-11 04:44:48+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevB.99.115132

In particular, we focus on Q-lattices and the Bianchy VII helix. We show that the hydrodynamic sound mode is removed from the spectrum due to the strong momentum relaxation and therefore, the usual treatment of the plasmon as Coulomb-dressed zero sound does not apply. Furthermore, the dominant coherent modes in the longitudinal channel, which control the neutral density-density correlator, are diffusive. We show these modes are strongly suppressed when the boundary Coulomb interaction is turned on. This renders the low frequency charge density response spectrum completely incoherent and featureless. At intermediate frequencies, we observe a broad feature -- the fake plasmon -- in the dressed correlator, which could be confused with an overdamped plasmon. However, its gap is set by the scale of translation symmetry breaking instead of the plasma frequency. This broad feature originates from the non-hydrodynamic sector of the holographic spectrum, and therefore, its behaviour, typical of strongly correlated quantum critical systems with holographic duals, deviates from the standard Fermi-liquid paradigm.",2019-09-26 16:41:42+00:00,10.1007/JHEP12(2019)159

In the theory dual to a Reissner-Nordstr\""om background, this deformation leads to gapped plasmon modes in the density-density response, as expected from conventional RPA calculations. We further show that by introducing a $(d + 1)$-dimensional Coulomb interaction in a boundary theory in $d$ spacetime dimensions, we recover plasmon modes whose dispersion is proportional to $\sqrt{|\mathbf{k}|}$, as observed for example in graphene layers. Moreover, motivated by recent experimental results in layered cuprate high-temperature superconductors, we present a toy model for a layered system consisting of an infinite stack of (spatially) two-dimensional layers, that are coupled only by the long-range Coulomb interaction. This leads to low-energy `acoustic plasmons'.

As an illustrative example of open quantum bosonic systems, we study symmetry classes of dissipative quantum spin models.

The characteristic initial (boundary) value problem has numerous applications in general relativity involving numerical studies and is often formulated using Bondi-like coordinates. Well-posedness of the resulting systems of partial differential equations, however, remains an open question. The answer to this question affects the accuracy, and potentially the reliability of conclusions drawn from numerical studies based on such formulations. In the first part of this thesis, we expand our understanding of the hyperbolicity and well-posedness of Bondi-like free evolution systems. We show that several prototype Bondi-like formulations are only weakly hyperbolic and examine the root cause of this result. Consequently, the characteristic initial (boundary) value problem of general relativity in these gauges is rendered ill-posed in the simplest norms one would like to employ. We discuss the implications of this result in accurate gravitational waveform modeling methods and work towards the construction of alternative norms that might be more appropriate. We also present numerical tests that demonstrate weak hyperbolicity in practice and highlight important features to perform them effectively. In the second part, we turn our attention to applications of these formulations to the qualitative behavior of strongly coupled systems via holography.",2023-08-30 12:41:19+00:00,10.48550/2308.16001

Depending on the model parameter, there are two kinds of mechanisms driving quantum phase transition (QPT) in this model. One is the infrared (IR) geometry to be renormalization group (RG) unstable, and the other is the strength of lattice deformation leading to some kind of bifurcating solution. We also find a novel QPT in the metal phases. The study on the behavior of the butterfly velocity crossing QPT indicates that the butterfly velocity or its first derivative exhibiting local extreme depends on the QPT mechanism. Further, the scaling behaviors of the butterfly velocity in the zero-temperature limit confirm that different phases are controlled by different IR geometries. Therefore, the butterfly velocity is a good probe to QPT and it also provides a possible way to study QPT beyond holography.",2022-02-03 10:09:53+00:00,10.1007/JHEP04(2022)148

For the dilute Fermi gas at unitarity we find $\eta/s\gsim 0.2\hbar$. This bound is not universal -- it depends on thermodynamic properties of the unitary Fermi gas, and on empirical information about the range of validity of hydrodynamics.

In particular, the universality arguments imply that the shear viscosity of ultracold Fermi atoms at the Feschbach resonance is proportional to the particle number density n, and the Plank constant \hbar \eta=\hbar n \alpha_\eta, where \alpha_\eta is a universal constant. Using Heisenberg uncertainty principle and Einstein's relation between diffusion and viscosity we argue that the viscosity has the lower bound given by \alpha_{\eta} \leq (6\pi)^{-1}. We relate the damping of low-frequency density oscillations of ultracold optically trapped ^{6}Li atoms to viscosity and find that the value of the coefficient \alpha_\eta is about 0.3.

In this letter, we show that disorder averaging and replica instantons emerge naturally from a gravitational effective theory built out of typical microscopic states.

We see that the locations of the branch points extracted using the first approach are in good quantitative agreement with the radius of convergence extracted perturbatively. We see that for different values of the charge, different types of pole collisions set the radius of convergence. The latter turns out to be finite in the neutral case for all hydrodynamic modes, while it goes to zero at extremality for the shear and sound modes.

We also analytically compute the spectrum of hydrodynamic excitations in the small chemical potential limit. Then, by studying the spectral curve at complex momenta in every spin channel, we numerically find points at which hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic poles collide. We discuss the relation between such collision points and the convergence radius of the hydrodynamic derivative expansion. Specifically in the spin 0 channel, we find that within the range $1.1\lesssim \mu/T\lesssim 2$, the radius of convergence of the hydrodynamic sound mode is set by the absolute value of the complex momentum corresponding to the point at which the sound pole collides with the hydrodynamic diffusion pole. It shows that in holographic systems at finite chemical potential, the convergence of the hydrodynamic derivative expansion in the mentioned range is fully controlled by hydrodynamic information. As the last result, we explicitly show that the relevant information about quantum chaos in our system can be extracted from the pole-skipping points of energy density response function.

It is found that the first law requires a modification by including an additional term that has a particular form $\sim\left<O\right>\delta \phi_s$, with $\phi_s$ and $\left<O\right>$ a new pair of thermodynamic conjugate variables. $\phi_s$ is the leading source term of the asymptotic fall-off of the scalar field near the AdS boundary, and $\left<O\right>$ is precisely the response of the dual scalar operator from the holographic point of view.

In the vicinity of a quantum critical point, it is expected that some aspects of the dynamics are universal and dictated by properties of the critical point. We use gauge-gravity duality to investigate the breakdown of diffusive hydrodynamics in two low temperature states dual to black holes with AdS$_2$ horizons, which exhibit quantum critical dynamics with an emergent scaling symmetry in time. We find that the breakdown is characterized by a collision between the diffusive pole of the retarded Green's function with a pole associated to the AdS$_2$ region of the geometry, such that the local equilibration time is set by infra-red properties of the theory. The absolute values of the frequency and wavevector at the collision ($\omega_{eq}$ and $k_{eq}$) provide a natural characterization of all the low temperature diffusivities $D$ of the states via $D=\omega_{eq}/k_{eq}^2$ where $\omega_{eq}=2\pi\Delta T$ is set by the temperature $T$ and the scaling dimension $\Delta$ of an operator of the infra-red quantum critical theory.

We calculate the associated prefactors for potentials with $C_3$ and $C_4$ symmetry. On the other hand, for a random potential the resistivity has qualitatively different behavior because equipotential paths become increasingly tortuous as their width is reduced.

Our study is situated in the context of Gaussian quantum states, which are fundamental to both Bosonic and Fermionic systems and can be fully described by a covariance matrix.

One widely studied example of an OPE block is the modular Hamiltonian, which is dual to the fluctuation in the area of a minimal surface. Thus, our operators pave the way for generalizing the Ryu-Takayanagi relation to other bulk fields.

For TFD states at t > 0, we demonstrate that the complexity evolves in time and saturates after a time of the order of the inverse temperature. The latter feature, which is in contrast with the results of holographic proposals, is due to the Gaussian nature of the TFD state of the free bosonic QFT. A novel technical aspect of our work is framing complexity calculations in the language of covariance matrices and the associated symplectic transformations, which provide a natural language for dealing with Gaussian states. Furthermore, for free QFTs in 1+1 dimension, we compare the dynamics of circuit complexity with the time dependence of the entanglement entropy for simple bipartitions of TFDs. We relate our results for the entanglement entropy to previous studies on non-equilibrium entanglement evolution following quenches.

Inhomogeneous cost functions ---many examples of which have been recently proposed in the literature--- are ruled out by our analysis. Such measures are shown to be unrelated to circuit complexity in general and to produce severe violations of Lloyd's bound in simple situations. Among the metrics which do provide lower bounds, the idea is to select those which produce the tightest possible ones. This establishes a hierarchy of cost functions and considerably reduces the list of candidate complexity measures. In particular, the criterion suggests a canonical way of dealing with penalties, consisting in assigning infinite costs to directions not belonging to the gate set. We discuss how this can be implemented through the use of Lagrange multipliers. We argue that one of the surviving cost functions defines a particularly canonical notion in the sense that: i) it straightforwardly follows from the standard Hermitian metric in Hilbert space; ii) its associated complexity functional is closely related to Kirillov's coadjoint orbit action, providing an explicit realization of the ``complexity equals action'' idea; iii) it arises from a Hamilton-Jacobi analysis of the ``quantum action'' describing quantum dynamics in the phase space canonically associated to every Hilbert space. Finally, we explain how these structures provide a natural framework for characterizing chaos in classical and quantum systems on an equal footing, find the minimal geodesic connecting two nearby trajectories, and describe how complexity measures are sensitive to Lyapunov exponents.",2019-08-09 18:00:02+00:00,10.48550/1908.03577
2004.03619,Complexity measures from geometric actions on Virasoro and Kac-Moody orbits,Johanna Erdmenger ; Marius Gerbershagen ; Anna-Lena Weigel,hep-th,hep-th,"We further advance the study of the notion of computational complexity for 2d CFTs based on a gate set built out of conformal symmetry transformations. Previously, it was shown that by choosing a suitable cost function, the resulting complexity functional is equivalent to geometric (group) actions on coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro group, up to a term that originates from the central extension. We show that this term can be recovered by modifying the cost function, making the equivalence exact. Moreover, we generalize our approach to Kac-Moody symmetry groups, finding again an exact equivalence between complexity functionals and geometric actions. We then determine the optimal circuits for these complexity measures and calculate the corresponding costs for several examples of optimal transformations. In the Virasoro case, we find that for all choices of reference state except for the vacuum state, the complexity only measures the cost associated to phase changes, while assigning zero cost to the non-phase changing part of the transformation. For Kac-Moody groups in contrast, there do exist non-trivial optimal transformations beyond phase changes that contribute to the complexity, yielding a finite gauge invariant result. Furthermore, we also show that the alternative complexity proposal of path integral optimization is equivalent to the Virasoro proposal studied here. Finally, we sketch a new proposal for a complexity definition for the Virasoro group that measures the cost associated to non-trivial transformations beyond phase changes. This proposal is based on a cost function given by a metric on the Lie group of conformal transformations. The minimization of the corresponding complexity functional is achieved using the Euler-Arnold method yielding the Korteweg-de Vries equation as equation of motion.",2020-04-07 18:00:30+00:00,10.1007/JHEP11(2020)003

We show that this state factorizes between positively and negatively charged modes and demonstrate that this fact can be used to relate it, for each momentum mode separately, to two uncharged thermofield double states with shifted temperatures and times.

Myers,hep-th,hep-th gr-qc,"We argue that the degrees of freedom in a d-dimensional CFT can be re-organized in an insightful way by studying observables on the moduli space of causal diamonds (or equivalently, the space of pairs of timelike separated points). This 2d-dimensional space naturally captures some of the fundamental nonlocality and causal structure inherent in the entanglement of CFT states. For any primary CFT operator, we construct an observable on this space, which is defined by smearing the associated one-point function over causal diamonds. Known examples of such quantities are the entanglement entropy of vacuum excitations and its higher spin generalizations. We show that in holographic CFTs, these observables are given by suitably defined integrals of dual bulk fields over the corresponding Ryu-Takayanagi minimal surfaces. Furthermore, we explain connections to the operator product expansion and the first law of entanglement entropy from this unifying point of view. We demonstrate that for small perturbations of the vacuum, our observables obey linear two-derivative equations of motion on the space of causal diamonds. In two dimensions, the latter is given by a product of two copies of a two-dimensional de Sitter space. For a class of universal states, we show that the entanglement entropy and its spin-three generalization obey nonlinear equations of motion with local interactions on this moduli space, which can be identified with Liouville and Toda equations, respectively. This suggests the possibility of extending the definition of our new observables beyond the linear level more generally and in such a way that they give rise to new dynamically interacting theories on the moduli space of causal diamonds.

We give an explicit formula for the volume of a general region in the spatial slice as an integral over kinematic space. For the region lying below a geodesic, we show how to write this volume purely in terms of entangling entropies in the dual CFT. This expression is perhaps most interesting in light of the complexity=volume proposal, which posits that complexity of holographic quantum states is computed by bulk volumes. An extension of this idea proposes that the holographic subregion complexity of an interval, defined as the volume under its Ryu-Takayanagi surface, is a measure of the complexity of the corresponding reduced density matrix. If this is true, our results give an explicit relationship between entanglement and subregion complexity in CFT, at least in the vacuum.

For either prescription, the complexity relative to $n$ copies of the $M=0$ BTZ black hole takes the form $\Delta C = \alpha c \chi $, where $c$ is the central charge and $\chi$ is the Euler character of the bulk time-symmetric surface. The coefficients $\alpha_V = -4\pi/3$, $\alpha_A = 1/6 $ defined by CV and CA are independent of both temperature and any moduli controlling the geometry inside the black hole. Comparing with the known structure of dual CFT states in the hot wormhole limit, the temperature and moduli independence of $\alpha_V$, $\alpha_A$ implies that any CFT gate set defining either complexity cannot be local. In particular, the complexity of an efficient quantum circuit building local thermofield-double-like entanglement of thermal-sized patches does not depend on the separation of the patches so entangled.

When the field theory has a holographic dual obeying the Ryu-Takayanagi proposal, kinematic space has a direct geometric meaning: it is the space of bulk geodesics studied in integral geometry. Lengths of bulk curves are computed by kinematic volumes, giving a precise entropic interpretation of the length of any bulk curve. We explain how basic geometric concepts -- points, distances and angles -- are reflected in kinematic space, allowing one to reconstruct a large class of spatial bulk geometries from boundary entanglement entropies.

1908.08514,Reflections on Virasoro circuit complexity and Berry phase,Ibrahim Akal,hep-th,hep-th quant-ph,"Recently, the notion of circuit complexity defined in symmetry group manifolds has been related to geometric actions which generally arise in the coadjoint orbit method in representation theory and play an important role in geometric quantization. On the other hand, it is known that there exists a precise relation between geometric actions and Berry phases defined in group representations. Motivated by these connections, we elaborate on a relation between circuit complexity and the group theoretic Berry phase. As the simplest setup relevant for holography, we discuss the case of two dimensional conformal field theories. In the large central charge limit, we identify the computational cost function with the Berry connection in the unitary representation of the Virasoro group. We then use the latter identification to express the Berry phase in terms of the Virasoro circuit complexity. The former can be seen as the holonomy of the Berry connection along the path in the group manifold which defines the protocol. In addition, we derive a proportionality relation between Virasoro circuit complexity and the logarithm of the inner product between a particularly chosen reference state and the prepared target state. In this sense, the logarithmic formula turns out to be approximating the complexity up to some additive constant if the building blocks of the circuit are taken to be the underlying symmetry gates. Predictions based on this formula have recently been shown to coincide with the holographic complexity proposals and the path integral optimization procedure. The found connections may therefore help to better understand such coincidences. We also discuss that our findings, put together with earlier observations, may suggest a connection between the Virasoro Berry phase and the complexity measure in the path integral optimization proposal.",2019-08-22 17:46:13+00:00,10.48550/1908.08514

Based on this observation, in this paper we propose to interpret the tensor networks themselves as a path integrals on curved spacetime. This perspective assigns (a discrete, approximate version of) a geometry to the tensor network, namely that of the underlying curved spacetime.",2018-07-06 17:38:38+00:00,10.48550/1807.02501

In particular, we argue, using representation theory of parabolic Verma modules, that in odd spacetime dimension the singularities are only simple poles. We discuss how to use this information to write recursion relations that determine the conformal blocks. We first recover the recursion relation introduced in 1307.6856 for conformal blocks of external scalar operators.

This is achieved by performing a scaling analysis of this quantum geometric tensor in the vicinity of the critical points. In this way most of the previous results are understood on general grounds and new ones are found.

We found that when the oscillator is regular the COP saturates quickly for both underdamped and overdamped oscillators. Interestingly, when the oscillator is underdamped, we discover a kink like behaviour for the saturation value of COP with varying damping coefficient. For the inverted oscillator, we found a linear growth of COP with time for all values of bath-system interaction.

In this work, we probe such an integrable system exhibiting saddle dominated scrambling through Krylov complexity and the associated Lanczos coefficients. In the realm of the universal operator growth hypothesis, we demonstrate that the Lanczos coefficients follow the linear growth, which ensures the exponential behavior of Krylov complexity at early times. The linear growth arises entirely due to the saddle, which dominates other phase-space points even away from itself. Our results reveal that the exponential growth of Krylov complexity can be observed in integrable systems with saddle-dominated scrambling and thus need not be associated with the presence of chaos.",2022-03-07 17:29:24+00:00,10.1007/JHEP05(2022)174

One of its new signatures is a large negative thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{\rm xy}$, which appears for dopings $p$ below the pseudogap critical doping $p^*$, but whose origin is as yet unknown. Because this large $\kappa_{\rm xy}$ is observed even in the undoped Mott insulator La$_2$CuO$_4$, it cannot come from charge carriers, these being localized at $p = 0$. Here we show that the thermal Hall conductivity of La$_2$CuO$_4$ is roughly isotropic, being nearly the same for heat transport parallel and normal to the CuO$_2$ planes, i.e. $\kappa_{\rm zy}(T) \approx \kappa_{\rm xy} (T)$. This shows that the Hall response must come from phonons, these being the only heat carriers able to move as easily normal and parallel to the planes . At $p > p^*$, in both La$_{\rm 1.6-x}$Nd$_{\rm 0.4}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ and La$_{\rm 1.8-x}$Eu$_{\rm 0.2}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ with $p = 0.24$, we observe no c-axis Hall signal, i.e. $\kappa_{\rm zy}(T) = 0$, showing that phonons have zero Hall response outside the pseudogap phase. The phonon Hall response appears immediately below $p^* = 0.23$, as confirmed by the large $\kappa_{\rm zy}(T)$ signal we find in La$_{1.6-x}$Nd$_{\rm 0.4}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ with $p = 0.21$. The microscopic mechanism by which phonons become chiral in cuprates remains to be identified. This mechanism must be intrinsic - from a coupling of phonons to their electronic environment - rather than extrinsic, from structural defects or impurities, as these are the same on both sides of $p^*$. This intrinsic phonon Hall effect provides a new window on quantum materials and it may explain the thermal Hall signal observed in other topologically nontrivial insulators.",2020-02-28 23:15:32+00:00,10.1038/s41567-020-0965-y

Thus, the Stefan-Boltzmann law tells us that the black hole temperature, defined by the emission rate of the black hole energy, starts from zero temperature and reaches a maximum value at a critical time, and finally vanishes.

2307.02536,Postmodern Fermi Liquids,Umang Mehta,cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.str-el hep-th,"We present, in this dissertation, a pedagogical review of the formalism for Fermi liquids developed in [Delacretaz et al., arXiv:220305004] that exploits an underlying algebro-geometric structure described by the group of canonical transformations of a single particle phase space. This infinite-dimensional group governs the space of states of zero temperature Fermi liquids and thereby allows us to write down a nonlinear, bosonized action that reproduces Landau's kinetic theory in the classical limit. Upon quantizing, we obtain a systematic effective field theory as an expansion in nonlinear and higher derivative corrections suppressed by the Fermi momentum $p_F$, without the need to introduce artificial momentum scales through, e.g., decomposition of the Fermi surface into patches. We find that Fermi liquid theory can essentially be thought of as a non-trivial representation of the Lie group of canonical transformations, bringing it within the fold of effective theories in many-body physics whose structure is determined by symmetries. We survey the benefits and limitations of this geometric formalism in the context of scaling, diagrammatic calculations, scattering and interactions, coupling to background gauge fields, etc. After setting up a path to extending this formalism to include superconducting and magnetic phases, as well as applications to the problem of non-Fermi liquids, we conclude with a discussion on possible future directions for Fermi surface physics, and more broadly, the usefulness of diffeomorphism groups in condensed matter physics. Unlike [Delacretaz et al., arXiv:220305004], we present a microscopic perspective on this formalism, motivated by the closure of the algebra of bilocal fermion bilinears and the consequences of this fact for finite density states of interacting fermions.",2023-07-05 18:00:02+00:00,10.48550/2307.02536

Compared with the original concept of complexity based on the minimal number of gates required to construct the desired operation as a product, this geometrical approach amounts to a more concrete and computable definition, but its evaluation is nontrivial in systems with a high-dimensional Hilbert space. The geometrical formulation can more easily be evaluated by considering the geometry associated with a suitable finite-dimensional group generated by a small number of relevant operators of the system. In this way, the method has been applied in particular to the harmonic oscillator, which is also of interest in the present paper. However, subtle and previously unrecognized issues of group theory can lead to unforeseen complications, motivating a new formulation that remains on the level of the underlying Lie algebras for most of the required steps. Novel insights about complexity can thereby be found in a low-dimensional setting, with the potential of systematic extensions to higher dimensions as well as interactions. Specific examples include the quantum complexity of various target unitary operators associated with a harmonic oscillator, inverted harmonic oscillator, and coupled harmonic oscillators. The generality of this approach is demonstrated by an application to an anharmonic oscillator with a cubic term.",2023-07-25 18:00:07+00:00,10.48550/2307.13736

Nevertheless, for a local shock wave that depends on transverse coordinates, the action growth (complexity) is proportional to the butterfly velocity for the two gravity theories, but the butterfly velocity of the massive gravity theory is smaller than that of the Einstein gravity theory, indicating that the action growth (complexity) of the massive gravity is depressed by the graviton mass.

We center our discussion around adiabatic gauge potentials, which are the generators of unitary basis transformations in quantum systems and generators of special canonical transformations in classical systems. In quantum systems, eigenstate expectation values of these potentials are the Berry connections and the covariance matrix of these gauge potentials is the geometric tensor, whose antisymmetric part defines the Berry curvature and whose symmetric part is the Fubini-Study metric tensor. In classical systems one simply replaces the eigenstate expectation value by an average over the micro-canonical shell. For complicated interacting systems, we show that a variational principle may be used to derive approximate gauge potentials. We then express the non-adiabatic response of the physical observables of the system through these gauge potentials, specifically demonstrating the close connection of the geometric tensor to the notions of Lorentz force and renormalized mass. We highlight applications of this formalism to deriving counter-diabatic (dissipationless) driving protocols in various systems, as well as to finding equations of motion for slow macroscopic parameters coupled to fast microscopic degrees of freedom that go beyond macroscopic Hamiltonian dynamics. Finally, we illustrate these ideas with a number of simple examples and highlight a few more complicated ones drawn from recent literature.",2016-02-02 19:55:41+00:00,10.1016/j.physrep.2017.07.001
quant-ph/0502070,A geometric approach to quantum circuit lower bounds,Michael A. Nielsen,quant-ph,quant-ph,"What is the minimal size quantum circuit required to exactly implement a specified n-qubit unitary operation, U, without the use of ancilla qubits? We show that a lower bound on the minimal size is provided by the length of the minimal geodesic between U and the identity, I, where length is defined by a suitable Finsler metric on SU(2^n). The geodesic curves of such a metric have the striking property that once an initial position and velocity are set, the remainder of the geodesic is completely determined by a second order differential equation known as the geodesic equation. This is in contrast with the usual case in circuit design, either classical or quantum, where being given part of an optimal circuit does not obviously assist in the design of the rest of the circuit. Geodesic analysis thus offers a potentially powerful approach to the problem of proving quantum circuit lower bounds. In this paper we construct several Finsler metrics whose minimal length geodesics provide lower bounds on quantum circuit size, and give a procedure to compute the corresponding geodesic equation. We also construct a large class of solutions to the geodesic equation, which we call Pauli geodesics, since they arise from isometries generated by the Pauli group. For any unitary U diagonal in the computational basis, we show that: (a) provided the minimal length geodesic is unique, it must be a Pauli geodesic; (b) finding the length of the minimal Pauli geodesic passing from I to U is equivalent to solving an exponential size instance of the closest vector in a lattice problem (CVP); and (c) all but a doubly exponentially small fraction of such unitaries have minimal Pauli geodesics of exponential length.",2005-02-11 23:54:58+00:00,10.48550/quant-ph/0502070

This is evident in the behavior of the distribution of holographically dual Fermi surfaces. As we decrease the number of constituents in a fixed electron star background the number of Fermi surfaces also decreases.

This IR scaling region is a consequence of the two way interaction between emergent quantum critical bosonic modes and the finite density of fermions.

For a holographic system at a nonzero chemical potential, this unstable phase sets in at an energy scale of order of the chemical potential, and orders at lower energies into other phases; examples include superconductors and antiferromagnetic-type states. In this paper we give examples in which it also orders into Fermi liquids of ""heavy"" fermions.

We show that various deformations in the gravity dual, such as inclusion of magnetic fields, a parity-violating theta-term, dilatonic deformations, and higher-derivative corrections, do not violate the holographic derivation of the Luttinger theorem, as long as the theory is in a confining phase. Therefore a robustness of the theorem is found for strongly correlated fermions coupled with strongly coupled sectors which admit gravity duals.

This points to collective excitations (a sound mode) as carriers of heat. We propose that this mode has a wavevector of 2$k_F$ and a mean free path equal to the de Broglie thermal length. This would provide an additional conducting channel with a $T^{1/2}$ temperature dependence, matching what is observed by experiments. The experimental data from 0.007 K to 3 K can be accounted for, with a margin of 10\%, if thermal conductivity is the sum of two contributions: one by quasi-particles (varying as the inverse of temperature) and and another by sound (following the square root of temperature).",2023-09-01 14:50:13+00:00,10.1038/s41467-024-46079-0

In the hydrodynamic regime of metals, momentum relaxes slowly with a rate $\Gamma$, which formally appears on the right-hand side of the momentum dynamical equation and causes a Drude-like peak in the frequency dependence of the thermoelectric conductivities. Here we study the structure and determine the physical implications of momentum-relaxing gradient corrections beyond Drude, \emph{i.e.} arising at subleading order in the gradient expansion. We find that they effectively renormalize the weight of the Drude pole in the thermoelectric conductivities, and contribute to the dc conductivities at the same order as previously-known gradient corrections of translation-invariant hydrodynamics. Turning on a magnetic field, extra derivative corrections appear and renormalize the cyclotron frequency and the Hall conductivity. This relaxed hydrodynamics provides a field-theoretic explanation for previous results obtained using gauge-gravity duality. In strongly-coupled metals where quasiparticles are short-lived and which may be close to a hydrodynamic regime, the extra contributions we discuss are essential to interpret experimentally measured magneto-thermoelectric conductivities. Specializing to metals close to a Fermi liquid phase, the effective mass measured either through the specific heat or the spectral weight of the Drude-like peak are found to differ, as was indeed reported in overdoped cuprate superconductors. More generally, we expect such terms to be present in any hydrodynamic theory with approximate symmetries, which arise in many physical systems.",2023-09-07 22:00:04+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevB.109.165153

In materials exhibiting such behavior, the change in slope of the resistivity as the mean free path drops below the lattice constant, or as $T \rightarrow 0$, can be imperceptible, suggesting complete continuity between the charge carriers at low and high $T$. Since particles cannot scatter at length scales shorter than the interatomic spacing, strange metallicity calls into question the relevance of locality and a particle picture of the underlying current. This review focuses on transport and spectroscopic data on candidate strange metals with an eye to isolate and identify a unifying physical principle. Special attention is paid to quantum criticality, Planckian dissipation, Mottness, and whether a new gauge principle, which has a clear experimental signature, is needed to account for the non-local transport seen in strange metals.

This paper introduces FiniteFieldSolve, a general-purpose toolkit for exactly solving large linear systems over the rationals. The solver interfaces directly with Mathematica, is straightforward to install, and seamlessly replaces Mathematica's native solvers. In testing, FiniteFieldSolve is approximately two orders of magnitude faster than Mathematica and uses an order of magnitude less memory. The package also compares favorably against other public solvers in FiniteFieldSolve's intended use cases. As the name of the package suggests, solutions are obtained via well-known finite field methods. These methods suffer from introducing an inordinate number of modulo (or integer division) operations with respect to different primes. By automatically recompiling itself for each prime, FiniteFieldSolve converts the division operations into much faster combinations of instructions, dramatically improving performance. The technique of compiling the prime can be applied to any finite field solver, where the time savings will be solver dependent. The operation of the package is illustrated through a detailed example of an amplitude bootstrap.",2023-11-03 02:32:17+00:00,10.1016/j.cpc.2024.109171

Zanchin,hep-th,hep-th gr-qc hep-ph nucl-th physics.flu-dyn,"The motion of water is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, which are complemented by the continuity equation to ensure local mass conservation. In this work, we construct the relativistic generalization of these equations through a gradient expansion for a fluid with conserved charge in a curved $d$-dimensional spacetime. We adopt a general hydrodynamic frame approach and introduce the Irreducible-Structure (IS) algorithm, which is based on derivatives of both the expansion scalar and the shear and vorticity tensors. By this method, we systematically generate all permissible gradients up to a specified order and derive the most comprehensive constitutive relations for a charged fluid, accurate to third-order gradients. These constitutive relations are formulated to apply to ordinary, non-conformal, and conformally invariant charged fluids. Furthermore, we examine the hydrodynamic frame dependence of the transport coefficients for a non-conformal charged fluid up to the third order in the gradient expansion. The frame dependence of the scalar, vector, and tensor parts of the constitutive relations is obtained in terms of the field redefinitions of the fundamental hydrodynamic variables. Managing these frame dependencies is challenging due to their non-linear character. However, in the linear regime, these higher-order transformations become tractable, enabling the identification of a set of frame-invariant coefficients. An advantage of employing these coefficients is the possibility of studying the linear equations of motion in any chosen frame and, hence, we apply this approach to the Landau frame. Subsequently, these linear equations are solved in momentum space, yielding dispersion relations for shear, sound, and diffusive modes for a non-conformal charged fluid, expressed in terms of the frame-invariant transport coefficients.",2023-11-02 13:33:18+00:00,10.48550/2311.01232

These play a role in the 5d $SU(1,3)$-invariant theories that are conjectured to offer a full description of certain 6d superconformal field theories. We find the $(2n-1)$-dimensional manifestation of the supersymmetry of a free $2n$-dimensional boson-fermion system, which we use to fix the fermion two-point functions. It is then shown that the full $2n$-dimensional two-point function can be recovered through resummation.

In this work we explain why the standard classical limit fails when applied to subsystems, and show how one may resolve this by explicitly modelling the decoherence of a subsystem by its environment. Denoting the decoherence time $\tau$, we demonstrate that a double scaling limit in which $\hbar \rightarrow 0$ and $\tau \rightarrow 0$ such that the ratio $E_f =\hbar /\tau$ remains fixed leads to an irreversible open-system evolution with well-defined classical and quantum subsystems. The main technical result is showing that, for arbitrary Hamiltonians, the generators of partial versions of the Wigner, Husimi and Glauber-Sudarshan quasiprobability distributions may all be mapped in the above double scaling limit to the same completely-positive classical-quantum generator.

Delacrétaz,cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.str-el hep-th,"Transport and the approach to equilibrium in interacting classical and quantum systems is a challenging problem of both theoretical and experimental interest. One useful organizing principle characterizing equilibration is the dissipative universality class, the most prevalent one being diffusion. In this paper, we use the effective field theory (EFT) of diffusion to systematically obtain universal power-law corrections to diffusion. We then employ large-scale simulations of classical and quantum systems to explore their validity. In particular, we find universal scaling functions for the corrections to the dynamical structure factor $\langle n(x,t)n\rangle$, in the presence of a single $U(1)$ or $SU(2)$ charge in systems with and without particle-hole symmetry, and present the framework to generalize the calculation to multiple charges. Classical simulations show remarkable agreement with EFT predictions for subleading corrections, pushing precision tests of effective theories for thermalizing systems to an unprecedented level. Moving to quantum systems, we perform large-scale tensor-network simulations in unitary and noisy 1d Floquet systems with conserved magnetization. We find a qualitative agreement with EFT which becomes quantitative in the case of noisy systems. Additionally, we show how the knowledge of EFT corrections allows for fitting methods, which can improve the estimation of transport parameters at the intermediate times accessible by simulations and experiments. Finally, we explore non-linear response in quantum systems and find that EFT provides an accurate prediction for its behavior.

As a consequence of this variational expression, we obtain lower bounds on the correlation time, which provide speed limits on the self-averaging of observables. In equilibrium, the bound takes the form of a tradeoff relation between the long- and short-time fluctuations of an observable. Out of equilibrium, the tradeoff can be violated, leading to an acceleration of self-averaging. We relate this violation to the steady-state entropy production rate, as well as the geometric structure of the irreversible currents, giving rise to two complementary speed limits. One of these can be formulated as a lower estimate on the entropy production from the measurement of time-symmetric observables. Using an illustrating example, we show the intricate behavior of the correlation time out of equilibrium for different classes of observables and how this can be used to partially infer dissipation even if no time-reversal symmetry breaking can be observed in the trajectories of the observable.",2023-03-23 04:59:39+00:00,10.48550/2303.13038

Here we establish the T-linear behavior for 2D electron fluids, systems in which carrier collisions assist conduction, leading to resistance decreasing with temperature. This behavior originates from exotic hydrodynamics described by Fermi surface modulations evolving in space and time in an amoeba-like loop manner that features a large family of long-lived excitations manifest as multiple viscous modes. A cascade of these modes results in a linear T dependence that extends down to lowest temperatures, as well as a Kolmogorov-like fractional power -5/3 scaling of conductivity vs. wavenumber. These dependences provide a smoking gun for nonclassical hydrodynamics and are expected to be generic for strongly-correlated 2D systems with simple near-circular Fermi surfaces.",2023-10-12 17:48:21+00:00,10.48550/2310.08556

We also explore its connections to CFTs, modular symmetry, and holography. It is worth noting that this particular theory is topological in nature, which means that all the physical degrees of freedom are located on the boundary. Additionally, we can derive the boundary description on a torus, which takes the form of a 2D Schwarzian theory. This observation suggests that the relevant degrees of freedom for the theory can be described using this 2D theory. Because of the renormalizability of the 3D gravity theory, one can probe the quantum regime. This suggests that it is possible to investigate quantum phenomena. Unlike the conventional CFTs, when considering the AdS$_3$ background, the boundary theory loses modular symmetry. This represents a departure from the usual behavior of CFT and is quite intriguing. The Weyl transformation induces anomaly in CFTs, and we indicate that applying this transformation to the 2D Schwarzian theory leads to similar results. Summing over all geometries with the asymptotic AdS$_3$ boundary condition is equivalent to summing over a modular group. The partition function is one-loop exact and therefore an analytical expression from the summation. This theory holds potential applications in Quantum Information and is a recurring theme in the study of holography, where gravitational theories are connected with CFTs.",2023-10-07 03:10:39+00:00,10.48550/2310.04665

We then consider a set of quantum two-level systems as a bath, which can be realized as a collection of qubits.

The accuracy of the analytic approximation is at the (sub-) percent level for the real part and at the level of a few percent for the imaginary part, even when $\varepsilon$ is of order one.

Senthil,cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.stat-mech hep-th,Continuous phase transitions in equilibrium statistical mechanics were successfully described 50 years ago with the development of the renormalization group framework. This framework was initially developed in the context of phase transitions whose universal properties are captured by the long wavelength (and long time) fluctuations of a Landau order parameter field. Subsequent developments include a straightforward generalization to a class of $T = 0$ phase transitions driven by quantum fluctuations. In the last 2 decades it has become clear that there is a vast landscape of quantum phase transitions where the physics is not always usefully (or sometimes cannot be) formulated in terms of fluctuations of a Landau order parameter field. A wide class of such phase transitions - dubbed deconfined quantum critical points - involve the emergence of fractionalized degrees of freedom coupled to emergent gauge fields.

By studying their Fisher metrics, we derive some general lessons that may have important implications for the application of information geometry in holography. We begin by demonstrating that the symmetries of the physical theory under study play a strong role in the resulting geometry, and that the appearance of an AdS metric is a relatively general feature. We then investigate what information the Fisher metric retains about the physics of the underlying theory by studying the geometry for both the classical 2d Ising model and the corresponding 1d free fermion theory, and find that the curvature diverges precisely at the phase transition on both sides. We discuss the differences that result from placing a metric on the space of theories vs. states, using the example of coherent free fermion states. We compare the latter to the metric on the space of coherent free boson states and show that in both cases the metric is determined by the symmetries of the corresponding density matrix. We also clarify some misconceptions in the literature pertaining to different notions of flatness associated to metric and non-metric connections, with implications for how one interprets the curvature of the geometry. Our results indicate that in general, caution is needed when connecting the AdS geometry arising from certain models with the AdS/CFT correspondence, and seek to provide a useful collection of guidelines for future progress in this exciting area.",2020-01-08 19:00:01+00:00,10.21468/SciPostPhys.8.5.073
1912.06478,The quantum black hole as a gravitational hydrogen atom,Christian Corda ; Fabiano Feleppa,gr-qc,gr-qc astro-ph.HE hep-th,"Nathan Rosen's quantization approach to the gravitational collapse is applied in the simple case of a pressureless ""star of dust"" by finding the gravitational potential, the Schrodinger equation and the solution for the collapse's energy levels. By applying the constraints for a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) and by using the concept of BH effective state, previously introduced by one of the authors (CC), the BH quantum gravitational potential, Schrodinger equation and the BH energy spectrum are found. Remarkably, such an energy spectrum is in agreement (in its absolute value) with the one which was conjectured by Bekenstein in 1974 and consistent with other ones in the literature. This approach also permits to find an interesting quantum representation of the Schwarzschild BH ground state at the Planck scale. Moreover, two fundamental issues about BH quantum physics are addressed by this model: the area quantization and the singularity resolution. As regards the former, a result similar to the one obtained by Bekenstein, but with a different coefficient, has been found. About the latter, it is shown that the traditional classical singularity in the core of the Schwarzschild BH is replaced, in a full quantum treatment, by a two-particle system where the two components strongly interact with each other via a quantum gravitational potential.

We analyze the information carrying capacity of direct and black hole-orbiting null geodesics as well as of the timelike contributions that arise because the strong Huygens principle does not hold on the Schwarzschild background. We find, in particular, that the non-direct-null and timelike contributions, which do not possess an analog on Minkowski spacetime, can dominate over the direct null contributions. We cover the cases of both geodesic and accelerated emitters. Technically, we apply tools previously designed for the study of wave propagation in curved spacetimes to a relativistic quantum information communication setup, first for generic spacetimes, and then for the case of Schwarzschild spacetime in particular.",2020-02-13 12:44:20+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevD.101.125005
1909.13347,Quantum Information Approaches to Quantum Gravity,Jesse C. Cresswell,hep-th,hep-th quant-ph,"In this thesis we apply techniques from quantum information theory to study quantum gravity within the framework of the anti-de Sitter / conformal field theory correspondence (AdS/CFT). Through AdS/CFT, progress has been made in understanding the structure of entanglement in quantum field theories, and in how gravitational physics can emerge from these structures. However, this understanding is far from complete and will require the development of new tools to quantify correlations in CFT. This thesis presents refinements of a duality between operator product expansion (OPE) blocks in the CFT, giving the contribution of a conformal family to the OPE, and geodesic integrated fields in AdS which are diffeomorphism invariant quantities. This duality was originally discovered in the maximally symmetric setting of pure AdS dual to the CFT ground state. In less symmetric states the duality must be modified. Working with excited states within AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, this thesis shows how the OPE block decomposes into more fine-grained CFT observables that are dual to AdS fields integrated over non-minimal geodesics. Additionally, this thesis contains results on the dynamics of entanglement measures for general quantum systems. Results are presented for the family of quantum R\'enyi entropies and entanglement negativity. R\'enyi entropies are studied for general dynamics by imposing special initial conditions. Around pure, separable initial states, all R\'enyi entropies grow with the same timescale at leading, and next-to-leading order. Mathematical tools are developed for the differentiation of non-analytic matrix functions with respect to constrained arguments and are used to construct analytic expressions for derivatives of negativity. We establish bounds on the rate of change of state distinguishability and the rate of entanglement growth for closed systems. Note: Abstract shortened.",2019-09-29 19:24:59+00:00,10.48550/1909.13347

We study both cases where the unitaries are chosen with and without a conserved $U(1)$ charge and focus on two aspects of the dynamics. First, we study analytically and numerically the growth of the entanglement entropy of the system, showing that two different time scales appear: one is intrinsic to the internal dynamics (the scrambling time), while the other depends on the system-environment coupling. In the presence of a $U(1)$ conserved charge, we show that the entanglement follows a Page-like behavior in time: it begins to decrease in the middle stage of the ""evaporation"", and decreases monotonically afterwards. Second, we study the time needed to retrieve information initially injected in the system from measurements on the environment qudits. Based on explicit numerical computations, we characterize such time both when the retriever has control over the initial configuration or not, showing that different scales appear in the two cases.",2020-02-21 11:37:39+00:00,10.1007/JHEP04(2020)063
2002.10331,Black Hole as a Quantum Field Configuration,Hikaru Kawai ; Yuki Yokokura,hep-th,hep-th astro-ph.HE gr-qc hep-ph,"We describe 4D evaporating black holes as quantum field configurations by solving the semi-classical Einstein equation $G_{\mu\nu}=8\pi G \langle \psi|T_{\mu\nu}|\psi \rangle$ and quantum matter fields in a self-consistent manner. As the matter fields we consider $N$ massless free scalar fields ($N$ is large). We find a spherically symmetric self-consistent solution of the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ and state $|\psi\rangle$. Here, $g_{\mu\nu}$ is locally $AdS_2\times S^2$ geometry, and $|\psi\rangle$ provides $\langle \psi|T_{\mu\nu}|\psi \rangle=\langle0|T_{\mu\nu}|0 \rangle+T_{\mu\nu}^{(\psi)}$, where $|0\rangle$ is the ground state of the matter fields in the metric and $T_{\mu\nu}^{(\psi)}$ consists of the excitation of s-waves that describe the collapsing matter and Hawking radiation with the ingoing negative energy flow. This object is supported by a large tangential pressure $\langle0|T^\theta{}_\theta|0 \rangle$ due to the vacuum fluctuation of the bound modes with large angular momenta. This describes the interior of the black hole when the back reaction of the evaporation is considered. The black hole is a compact object with a surface (instead of horizon) that looks like a conventional black hole from the outside and eventually evaporates without a singularity. If we count the number of self-consistent configurations $\{|\psi\rangle\}$, we reproduce the area law of the entropy. This tells that the information is carried by the s-waves inside the black hole. $|\psi\rangle$ also describes the process that the negative ingoing energy flow created with Hawking radiation is superposed on the collapsing matter to decrease the total energy while the total energy density remains positive. As a special case, we consider conformal matter fields and show that the interior metric is determined by the matter content of the theory, which leads to a new constraint to the matter content.",2020-02-24 16:00:26+00:00,10.3390/universe6060077

1210.1281,Topological order: from long-range entangled quantum matter to an unification of light and electrons,Xiao-Gang Wen,cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.str-el hep-th quant-ph,"In primary school, we were told that there are four states of matter: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. In college, we learned that there are much more than four states of matter. For example, there are ferromagnetic states as revealed by the phenomenon of magnetization and superfluid states as defined by the phenomenon of zero-viscosity. The various phases in our colorful world are so rich that it is amazing that they can be understood systematically by the symmetry breaking theory of Landau. In this paper, we will review the progress in last 20 -- 30 years, during which we discovered that there are even more interesting phases that are beyond Landau symmetry breaking theory. We discuss new ""topological"" phenomena, such as topological degeneracy, that reveal the existence of those new phases - topologically ordered phases. Just like zero-viscosity defines the superfluid order, the new ""topological"" phenomena define the topological order at macroscopic level. As a new type of order, topological order requires a new mathematical frame work, such as fusion category and group cohomology, to describe it. More recently, we find that, at microscopical level, topological order is due to long-range quantum entanglements, just like fermion superfluid is due to fermion-pair condensation. Long-range quantum entanglements lead to many amazing emergent phenomena, such as fractional quantum numbers, fractional/non-Abelian statistics, and perfect conducting boundary channels. Long-range quantum entanglements can even provide a unified origin of light and electrons (or more generally, gauge interactions and Fermi statistics): light waves (gauge fields) are fluctuations of long-range entanglements, and electrons (fermions) are defects of long-range entanglements.",2012-10-04 02:56:53+00:00,10.1155/2013/198710

We do this by studying the simplest finite density system arising from the duality, obtained by turning on a nonzero chemical potential for a U(1) global symmetry of a CFT, and described on the gravity side by a charged black hole. We address the following questions of such a finite density system: 1. Does the system have a Fermi surface? What are the properties of low energy excitations near the Fermi surface? 2. Does the system have an instability to condensation of scalar operators? What is the critical behavior near the corresponding quantum critical point? We find interesting parallels with those of high T_c cuprates and heavy electron systems. Playing a crucial role in our discussion is a universal intermediate-energy phase, called a ""semi-local quantum liquid"", which underlies the non-Fermi liquid and novel quantum critical behavior of a system. It also provides a novel mechanism for the emergence of lower energy states such as a Fermi liquid or a superconductor.",2011-10-17 20:39:29+00:00,10.1142/9789814350525_0013

Overbosch,cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.supr-con,We forward here the case that the anomalous electron states found in cuprate superconductors and related systems are rooted in a deeply non-classical fermion sign structure. The collapse of Mottness as advocated by Phillips and supported by recent DCA results on the Hubbard model is setting the necessary microscopic conditions. The crucial insight is due to Weng who demonstrated that in the presence of Mottness the fundamental workings of quantum statistics changes and we will elaborate on the effects of this Weng statistics with an emphasis on characterizing these further using numerical methods. The pseudogap physics of the underdoped regime appears as a consequence of the altered statistics and the profound question is how to connect this by a continuous quantum phase transition to the overdoped regime ruled by normal Fermi-Dirac statistics. Proof of principle follows from Ceperley's constrained path integral formalism where states can be explicitly constructed showing a merger of Fermi-Dirac sign structure and scale invariance of the quantum dynamics.,2009-11-20 15:50:22+00:00,10.1098/rsta.2010.0188

The standard picture of Fermi liquids is first critically analyzed, pointing out some of its rather peculiar properties. The insightful work of Ceperley in constructing fermionic path integrals in terms of constrained world-lines is then reviewed. In this representation, the minus signs associated with Fermi-Dirac statistics are self consistently translated into a geometrical constraint structure (the {\em nodal hypersurface}) acting on an effective bosonic dynamics. As an illustrative example we use this formalism to study 1+1-dimensional systems, where statistics are irrelevant, and hence the sign problem can be circumvented. In this low-dimensional example, the structure of the nodal constraints leads to a lucid picture of the entropic interaction essential to one-dimensional physics. Working with the path integral in momentum space, we then show that the Fermi gas can be understood by analogy to a Mott insulator in a harmonic trap. Going back to real space, we discuss the topological properties of the nodal cells, and suggest a new holographic conjecture relating Fermi liquids in higher dimensions to soft-core bosons in one dimension. We also discuss some possible connections between mixed Bose/Fermi systems and supersymmetry.",2008-02-18 11:09:46+00:00,10.48550/0802.2455

Only recently, it has been suggested that fermion signs are fundamental for the universal behavior of critical metallic systems and crucially enhance their degree of quantum entanglement. In this work we explore potential connections between emergent scale invariance of fermion sign structures and scaling properties of bipartite entanglement entropies. Our analysis is based on a wavefunction ansatz that incorporates collective, long-range backflow correlations into fermionic Slater determinants. Such wavefunctions mimic the collapse of a Fermi liquid at a quantum critical point. Their nodal surfaces -- a representation of the fermion sign structure in many-particle configurations space -- show fractal behavior up to a length scale $\xi$ that diverges at a critical backflow strength. We show that the Hausdorff dimension of the fractal nodal surface depends on $\xi$, the number of fermions and the exponent of the backflow. For the same wavefunctions we numerically calculate the second R\'enyi entanglement entropy $S_2$. Our results show a cross-over from volume scaling, $S_2\sim \ell^\theta$ ($\theta=2$ in $d=2$ dimensions), to the characteristic Fermi-liquid behavior $S_2\sim \ell\ln \ell$ on scales larger than $\xi$. We find that volume scaling of the entanglement entropy is a robust feature of critical backflow fermions, independent of the backflow exponent and hence the fractal dimension of the scale invariant sign structure.",2016-05-09 08:52:16+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevB.95.155102

Such a single-hole wave function possesses finite angular momenta generated by hidden spin currents, which give rise to a novel ground state degeneracy in agreement with recent exact diagonalization (ED) and density matrix renormalization group (DMGR) results. We further show that the wave function can be decomposed into a quasiparticle component and an incoherent momentum distribution in excellent agreement with the DMRG results up to an $8\times 8 $ lattice. Such a two-component structure indicates the breakdown of Landau's one-to-one correspondence principle, and in particular, the quasiparticle spectral weight vanishes by a power law in the large sample-size limit. By contrast, turning off the phase string induced by the hole hopping in the so-called $\sigma\cdot t\text{-}J$ model, a conventional Bloch-wave wave function with a finite quasiparticle spectral weight can be recovered, also in agreement with the ED and DMRG results. The present study shows that a singular effect already takes place in the single-hole-doped Mott insulator, by which the bare hole is turned into a non-Landau quasiparticle with translational symmetry breaking.

hep-th/0209067,Lecture Notes on Holographic Renormalization,Kostas Skenderis,hep-th,hep-th,"We review the formalism of holographic renormalization. We start by discussing mathematical results on asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes. We then outline the general method of holographic renormalization. The method is illustrated by working all details in a simple example: a massive scalar field on anti-de Sitter spacetime. The discussion includes the derivation of the on-shell renormalized action, of holographic Ward identities, anomalies and RG equations, and the computation of renormalized one-, two- and four-point functions. We then discuss the application of the method to holographic RG flows. We also show that the results of the near-boundary analysis of asymptotically AdS spacetimes can be analytically continued to apply to asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes. In particular, it is shown that the Brown-York stress energy tensor of de Sitter spacetime is equal, up to a dimension dependent sign, to the Brown-York stress energy tensor of an associated AdS spacetime.",2002-09-09 13:31:06+00:00,10.1088/0264-9381/19/22/306

Powell,cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.quant-gas cond-mat.supr-con hep-ph quant-ph,"I give a pedagogical introduction to some of the many particles and gauge fields that can emerge in correlated matter. The standard model of materials is built on Landau's foundational principles: adiabatic continuity and spontaneous symmetry breaking. These ideas lead to quasiparticles that inherit their quantum numbers from fundamental particles, Nambu-Goldstone bosons, the Anderson-Higgs mechanism, and topological defects in order parameters. I then describe the modern discovery of physics beyond the standard model. Here, quantum correlations (entanglement) and topology play key roles in defining the properties of matter. This can lead to fractionalised quasiparticles that carry only a fraction of the quantum numbers that define fundamental particles. These particles can have exotic properties: for example Majorana fermions are their own antiparticles, anyons have exchange statistics that are neither bosonic nor fermionic, and magnetic monopoles do not occur in the vacuum. Gauge fields emerge naturally in the description of highly correlated matter and can lead to gauge bosons. Relationships to the standard model of particle physics are discussed.",2020-08-20 06:29:05+00:00,10.1080/00107514.2020.1832350
2010.08839,General Relativity from Quantum Field Theory,Gustav Uhre Jakobsen,hep-th,hep-th gr-qc,"The quantum field theoretic description of general relativity is a modern approach to gravity where gravitational force is carried by spin-2 gravitons. In the classical limit of this theory, general relativity as described by the Einstein field equations is obtained. This limit, where classical general relativity is derived from quantum field theory is the topic of this thesis. The Schwarzschild-Tangherlini metric, which describes the gravitational field of an inertial point particle in arbitrary space-time dimensions, $D$, is analyzed. The metric is related to the three-point vertex function of a massive scalar interacting with a graviton to all orders in $G_N$, and the one-loop contribution to this amplitude is computed from which the $G_N^2$ contribution to the metric is derived. To understand the gauge-dependence of the metric, covariant gauge is used which introduces the parameter, $\xi$, and the gauge-fixing function $G_\sigma$. In the classical limit, the gauge-fixing function turns out to be the coordinate condition, $G_\sigma=0$. As gauge-fixing function a novel family of gauges, which depends on an arbitrary parameter $\alpha$ and includes both harmonic and de Donder gauge, is used. Feynman rules for the graviton field are derived and important results are the graviton propagator in covariant gauge and a general formula for the n-graviton vertex in terms of the Einstein tensor. The Feynman rules are used both in deriving the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini metric from amplitudes and in the computation of the one-loop correction to the metric. The one-loop correction to the metric is independent of the covariant gauge parameter, $\xi$, and satisfies the gauge condition $G_\sigma=0$ where $G_\sigma$ is the family of gauges depending on $\alpha$. In space-time $D=5$ a logarithm appears in position space and this phenomena is analyzed in terms of redundant gauge freedom.",2020-10-17 18:19:42+00:00,10.48550/2010.08839

Amusingly, many of these developments have a connection to contributions in high-energy physics by Dirac. The review starts by a presentation of the Dirac magnetic monopole, goes on with the Berry phase in a two-level system and the geometrical/topological band theory for Bloch electrons in crystals. Next, specific examples of tight-binding models giving rise to lattice versions of the Dirac equation in various space dimension are presented: in 1D (Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models), 2D (graphene, boron nitride, Haldane model) and 3D (Weyl semi-metals). The focus is on topological insulators and topological semi-metals. The latter have a Fermi surface that is characterized as a topological defect. For topological insulators, the two alternative view points of twisted fiber bundles and of topological textures are developed. The minimal mathematical background in topology (essentially on homotopy groups and fiber bundles) is provided when needed. Topics rarely reviewed include: periodic versus canonical Bloch Hamiltonian (basis I/II issue), Zak versus Berry phase, the vanishing electric polarization of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and Dirac insulators.",2020-12-22 11:48:01+00:00,10.1088/2515-7639/abf0b5

If both the bath and the probe are described by same microscopic Hamiltonian, thermalization further entails that the probe imbibes the phase of the bath. We refer to this phenomenon as phase thermalization. However, it is not clear whether this phenomenon is realizable when the probe and the bath are described by different microscopic Hamiltonians. We show phase thermalization is possible even when the microscopic Hamiltonians differ significantly. We provide an explicit example, where the probe is a Fermi liquid realized by a Majorana chain with $n \gg 1$ fermions per site interacting through random hopping and the bath is an incoherent metal described by another Majorana chain with $N > n$ fermions per site interacting through arbitrarily long range random four-fermion interaction.

The usages of this model are very vast and they are a proof of the spectacular versatility of the framework.

2103.01876,Universal limitation of quantum information recovery: symmetry versus coherence,Hiroyasu Tajima ; Keiji Saito,quant-ph,quant-ph cond-mat.stat-mech,"Quantum information is scrambled via chaotic time evolution in many-body systems. The recovery of initial information embedded locally in the system from the scrambled quantum state is a fundamental concern in many contexts. From a dynamical perspective, information recovery can measure dynamical instability in quantum chaos, fault-tolerant quantum computing, and the black hole information paradox. This article considers general aspects of quantum information recovery when the scrambling dynamics have conservation laws due to Lie group symmetries. Here, we establish fundamental limitations on the information recovery from scrambling dynamics with arbitrary Lie group symmetries. We show universal relations between information recovery, symmetry, and quantum coherence, which apply to many physical situations. The relations predict that the behavior of the Hayden-Preskill black hole model changes qualitatively under the assumption of the energy conservation law. Consequently, we can rigorously prove that under the energy conservation law, the error of the information recovery from a small black hole remains unignorably large until it completely evaporates. Moreover, even when the black hole is very large, the recovery of information thrown into the black hole is not completed until most of the black hole evaporates. The relations also provide a unified view of the symmetry restrictions on quantum information processing, such as the approximate Eastin-Knill theorem and the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem for unitary gates.",2021-03-02 17:16:15+00:00,10.48550/2103.01876

Caprara,cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.supr-con,"Besides the mechanism responsible for high critical temperature superconductivity, the grand unresolved issue of the cuprates is the occurrence of a strange metallic state above the so-called pseudogap temperature $T^*$. Even though such state has been successfully described within a phenomenological scheme, the so-called Marginal Fermi-Liquid theory, a microscopic explanation is still missing. However, recent resonant X-ray scattering experiments identified a new class of charge density fluctuations characterized by low characteristic energies and short correlation lengths, which are related to the well-known charge density waves. These fluctuations are present over a wide region of the temperature-vs-doping phase diagram and extend well above $T^*$. Here we investigate the consequences of charge density fluctuations on the electron and transport properties and find that they can explain the strange metal phenomenology. Therefore, charge density fluctuations are likely the long-sought microscopic mechanism underlying the peculiarities of the metallic state of cuprates.",2019-05-24 13:40:30+00:00,10.1038/s42005-020-00505-z

As an initial probe of our result, we show it compares very well with experimental data for the resistivity of LSCO at different values of the applied field. We also apply our result to Bi2201 and show that the magnetoresistivity in the strange metal phase of this material, exhibits the $H^2$ to $H$ crossover, as we move from the weak to the strong field regime. Yet, despite of that, the magnetoresistivity does not present a quadrature scaling. Remarkably, the resistivity H-field derivative does scale as a function of $\frac{H}{T}$, in complete agreement with recent magneto-transport measurements made in the strange metal phase of cuprates \cite{Hussey2020}. We, finally, address the issue of the $T$-power-law dependence of the resistivity of overdoped cuprates and compare our results with experimental data for Tl2201.

Building upon this, we employ the concept of double holography to analyze the properties of the entanglement inequality in any given region. By utilizing kinematic space, we calculate the contribution of the bulk to the holographic entanglement entropy in double holography. In conclusion, we establish that kinematic space substantiates a conjecture, namely that the entanglement entropy of an entire region can be expressed as a linear combination of the entanglement entropy of a single interval within the entangled region.",2023-05-25 09:28:56+00:00,10.48550/2305.15885

Then we generalize our method into the RN-AdS black holes by adding a U(1) gauge field. We also investigate the fidelity between states excited by scalar operator in probe limit. In this case, it is surprising that the fidelity in standard quantization will suffer from new UV divergence though the usual holographic renormalization has been applied. We call for deep understanding for such divergence in the future.

Potential applications of noncommutative structures in high-energy physics and gravitational theory are also discussed. In particular, we review the formalism of noncommutative quantum mechanics based on the Seiberg--Witten map and propose a parameterization scheme to associate the noncommutative parameters with the Planck length and the cosmological constant. We show that noncommutativity gives rise to an effective gauge field, in the Schr\""{o}dinger and Pauli equations.

The R-matrix approach to the theory of quantum groups is discussed in detail and is taken as the basis of the quantization of classical Lie groups, as well as some Lie supergroups. We start by laying out the foundations of non-commutative and non-cocommutative Hopf algebras. Much attention has been paid to Hecke and Birman-Murakami-Wenzl (BMW) R-matrices and related quantum matrix algebras. Trigonometric solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation associated with the quantum groups GL_q(N), SO_q(N), Sp_q(2n) and supergroups GL_q(N|M), Osp_q(N|2m), as well as their rational (Yangian) limits, are presented. Rational R-matrices for exceptional Lie algebras and elliptic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation are also considered. The basic concepts of the group algebra of the braid group and its finite dimensional quotients (such as Hecke and BMW algebras) are outlined. A sketch of the representation theories of the Hecke and BMW algebras is given (including methods for finding idempotents and their quantum dimensions). Applications of the theory of quantum groups and Yang-Baxter equations in various areas of theoretical physics are briefly discussed.",2022-06-17 17:23:16+00:00,10.48550/2206.08902

In its treatment of topics covered in these standard texts, the presentation here typically includes steps skipped in Wald or MTW. Treatments of gravitational waves, particle orbits in black-hole backgrounds, the Teukolsky equation, and the initial value equations are motivated in part by the discoveries of gravitational waves from the inspiral and coalescence of binary black holes and neutron stars, advances in numerical relativity, and the expected LISA space-based observatory. The notes begin with a detailed presentation of special relativity with a geometrical orientation, starting with with time dilation and length contraction and including relativistic particles, fluids, electromagnetism, and curvilinear coordinates. Chaps. 2-5 cover curvature, the Einstein equation, relativistic stars, and black holes. Chap. 6, on gravitational waves, includes a discussion of detection and noise. Chap. 7 is a brief introduction to cosmology, deriving the metrics of homogeneous isotropic space, the equations governing a universe with matter, radiation and vacuum energy, and their solutions, and discussions of the cosmological redshift and on using gravitational waves to measure the Hubble constant. Chap. 8, on the initial value problem, has a section on the form of the equations used in numerical relativity. The Newman-Penrose formalism and the Teukolsky equation are covered in Chap. 9. Following that is a chapter on black-hole thermodynamics and a final chapter on the gravitational action and on conserved quantities for asymptotically flat spacetimes, using Noether's theorem.

Previous examinations of entanglement and holography have focused on specific classes of quantum systems due to the lack of computational techniques in field theory and the inherent limitation of holography. This dissertation informs various methods and formalisms to overcome these difficulties by extending the target quantum systems with mass and interactions, boundaries, and geometric variational ansatze. These approaches provide insights into the generalization of holography from the bottom up. This dissertation initiates a comprehensive study beyond conventional holography by establishing new techniques in quantum field theory, holography, and tensor networks. Focusing on entanglement entropy, we found it is generally expressed in terms of renormalized two-point correlators of both fundamental and composite operators. Beyond entanglement entropy, we found the operational meaning of the entanglement structure in generic tensor networks.

When the Higgs has no bulk mass, the AdS isometries are unbroken. We find in that case that the dual CFT has a non-conserved U(1) current whose anomalous dimension is proportional to the square of the Higgs vacuum expectation value.

Our formulation of electromagnetism features a Lagrangian which is gauge invariant, includes a classical complex field from which a divergenceless four-current may be derived, and reproduces all aspects of the classical theory of charged massive continua without any quantum effects.

Verma,physics.flu-dyn,physics.flu-dyn cond-mat.stat-mech hep-th nlin.CD,"Turbulent flows exhibit intriguing energy transfers. In this paper, we compute the renormalized viscosities, mode-to-mode energy transfers, energy fluxes, and shell-to-shell energy transfers for the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic turbulence (HDT) using field-theoretic methods. We employ Craya-Herring basis that provides separate renormalized viscosities and energy transfers for its two components. In addition, Craya-Herring basis eliminates complex tensor algebra and simplifies the calculations considerably. In the $k^{-5/3}$ spectral regime of 2D HDT, the energy transfers between neighbouring (local) wavenumbers are forward, but they are backwards for distant (nonlocal) wavenumbers. The individual transfers between the distant wavenumber shells are small, but their cumulative sum is significant and it overcomes the forward local transfer to yield a constant inverse energy cascade. For 3D HDT, the mode-to-mode and shell-to-shell energy transfers reveal forward energy transfers for both local and nonlocal wavenumbers. More importantly, using scale-by-scale energy transfers we show that the cumulative nonlocal and local energy transfers are of the same order, which is contrary to the assumption of local energy transfers in turbulence. For 3D HDT, the renormalized viscosity, $\nu_2(k)$, computed by us and other authors are in general agreement, and it varies as $k^{-4/3}$. For 2D HDT, our the renormalized viscosity, $\nu_1(k)>0$, but $\nu_1(k)$ reported in literature shows significant variations including a negative $\nu_1(k)$. In this paper, we argue that the inconsistencies in $\nu_1(k)$ indicate inadequacy of renormalization group analysis that takes into account only local interactions and excludes nonlocal ones. In 2D HDT, the opposing nature of local and nonlocal energy transfers amplifies the error in $\nu_1(k)$.",2023-07-19 06:12:23+00:00,10.48550/2309.05207

Subsequently, we write a generating function from which the complex metric, as well as higher order geometric tensors (affine connection, Riemann curvature tensor) can be obtained in terms of gauge invariant cumulants. The generating function explicitly relates the quantities which characterize the geometry of the parameter space to quantum fluctuations. We also show that for a mixed quantum-classical system both real and imaginary parts of the quantum metric contribute to the dynamics, if the mass tensor is Hermitian. A many operator generalization of the uncertainty principle results from taking the determinant of the complex quantum metric. We also calculate the quantum metric for a number of Lie group coherent states, including several representations of the $SU(1,1)$ group. In our examples non-trivial complex geometry results for generalized coherent states. A pair of oscillator states corresponding to the $SU(1,1)$ group gives a double series for its spectrum.

All physical observables relax at the same rate which scales with the final temperature through an exponent that depends universally on the low energy spectrum of the system and the bath. Such relaxation rate is derived using a hydrodynamic approximation in full agreement with the numerical solution of a set quantum kinetic equations derived from the Keldysh formalism for non-equilibrium Green's functions.

We observe that local criticality, in which energies scale but momenta do not, provides a distinct route to efficient umklapp scattering. We show that umklapp scattering by an ionic lattice in a locally critical theory leads to Gamma ~ T^(2\Delta(k_L)). Here \Delta(k_L) \geq 0 is the dimension of the (irrelevant or marginal) charge density operator J^t(w,k_L) in the locally critical theory, at the lattice momentum k_L.

If these symmetries are also spontaneously broken, the would-be Goldstone modes acquire a small mass, or inverse correlation length, and are referred to as pseudo-Goldstones. At nonzero temperature, the effects of dissipation can be captured by hydrodynamics at sufficiently long scales compared to the local equilibrium. Here we show that in the limit of weak explicit breaking, locality of hydrodynamics implies that the damping of pseudo-Goldstones is completely determined by their mass and diffusive transport coefficients. We present many applications: superfluids, QCD in the chiral limit, Wigner crystal and density wave phases in the presence of an external magnetic field or not, nematic phases and (anti-)ferromagnets. For electronic density wave phases, pseudo-Goldstone damping generates a contribution to the resistivity independent of the strength of disorder, which can have a linear temperature dependence provided the associated diffusivity saturates a bound.

Specifically, we decompose each conductivity into the sum of a coherent contribution due to momentum relaxation and an incoherent contribution, due to intrinsic current relaxation. This decomposition is different from those previously proposed, and is consistent with the known hydrodynamic properties in the translationally invariant limit.

This includes momentum relaxation times previously derived by the memory matrix formalism, and non-perturbative holographic results; in the latter case, this is subject to some important subtleties. Our formalism may extend some memory matrix computations to higher orders in the perturbative disorder strength, as well as give valuable insight into non-perturbative regimes. Strongly coupled metals with quantum critical contributions to transport generically transition between coherent and incoherent metals as disorder strength is increased at fixed temperature, analogous to mean field holographic treatments of disorder.

For the semi-local theory with 0 < eta < 2 we find a sharp discontinuity in the transverse spectral weight at a nonzero momentum k_*. The case eta = 1 is found to have additional symmetries and is soluble even at nonzero temperature. We show that this case exhibits a robust linear in temperature resistivity in the presence of random charged impurities.

We show ($\omega_{\text{eq}}, k_{\text{eq}}$) at low $T$ is determined by the diffusion constant $D$ and the scaling dimension $\Delta(0)$ of an infra-red operator: $\omega_{\text{eq}} = 2\pi T \Delta(0), \, k_{\text{eq}}^2 = \omega_{\text{eq}}/D$, where $\Delta(0)=1$ in the presence of magnetic fields. For the purpose of comparison, we have analytically shown $\Delta(0)=2$ for the axion model independent of the translational symmetry breaking pattern (explicit or spontaneous), which is complementary to previous numerical results.

The identification of a universal velocity scale, independent of the presence of well-defined quasiparticle excitations, is one of the major challenges of this program. A recent analysis, valid for emergent IR fixed points exhibiting local quantum criticality, and dual to IR AdS$_2$ geometries, suggests to identify such a velocity using the time and length scales at which hydrodynamics breaks down -- the equilibration velocity. The latter relates to the radius of convergence of the hydrodynamic expansion and it is extracted from a collision between a hydrodynamic diffusive mode and a non-hydrodynamic mode associated to the IR AdS$_2$ region. In this short note, we confirm this picture for holographic systems displaying the spontaneous breaking of translational invariance. Moreover, we find that, at zero temperature, the lower bound set by quantum chaos and the upper one defined by causality and hydrodynamics exactly coincide, determining uniquely the diffusion constant.

Specifically, we find that there is always a diffusion mode with diffusion constant proportional to the ratio of entropy density to energy density.

The information recovered from the shock wave can be reconstructed in terms of purely diffusion-like, linearized gravitational waves at the horizon of a single-sided black hole with specific regularity-enforced imaginary values of frequency and momentum. In two-derivative bulk theories, this horizon ""diffusion"" can be related to late-time momentum diffusion via a simple relation, which ceases to hold in higher-derivative theories. We then show that the same values of imaginary frequency and momentum follow from a dispersion relation of a hydrodynamic sound mode. The frequency, momentum and group velocity give the holographic Lyapunov exponent and the butterfly velocity. Moreover, at this special point along the sound dispersion relation curve, the residue of the retarded longitudinal stress-energy tensor two-point function vanishes. This establishes a direct link between a hydrodynamic sound mode at an analytically continued, imaginary momentum and the holographic butterfly effect. Furthermore, our results imply that infinitely strongly coupled, large-$N_c$ holographic theories exhibit properties similar to classical dilute gasses; there, late-time equilibration and early-time scrambling are also controlled by the same dynamics.",2017-10-02 21:45:47+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.231601

Axion-dilaton model is particularly interesting since it shows linear-$T$-resistivity, which may have something to do with the universal bound of diffusion. At finite density, there are two diffusion constants $D_\pm$ describing the coupled diffusion of charge and energy. By computing $D_\pm$ exactly, we find that in the incoherent regime ($\beta/T \gg 1,\ \beta/\mu \gg 1$) $D_+$ is identified with the charge diffusion constant ($D_c$) and $D_-$ is identified with the energy diffusion constant ($D_e$). In the coherent regime, at very small density, $D_\pm$ are `maximally' mixed in the sense that $D_+(D_-)$ is identified with $D_e(D_c)$, which is opposite to the case in the incoherent regime. In the incoherent regime $D_e \sim C_- \hbar v_B^2 / k_B T$ where $C_- = 1/2$ or 1 so it is universal independently of $\beta$ and $\mu$. However, $D_c \sim C_+ \hbar v_B^2 / k_B T$ where $C_+ = 1$ or $ \beta^2/16\pi^2 T^2$ so, in general, $C_+$ may not saturate to the lower bound in the incoherent regime, which suggests that the characteristic velocity for charge diffusion may not be the butterfly velocity.

We show how the deformations can be mapped into boundary terms of the gravity theory and how to reproduce the RG equations found in field theory. In the case of doubletrace deformations, and for bulk scalars with masses in the range $-d^2/4<m^2<-d^2/4+1$, the deformed theory flows between two fixed points of the renormalization group, manifesting a resonant behavior at the scale characterizing the transition between the two CFT's. On the gravity side the resonance is mapped into an IR non-normalizable mode (Gamow state) whose overlap with the UV region increases as the dual operator approaches the free field limit. We argue that this resonant behavior is a generic property of large N theories in the conformal window, and associate it to a remnant of the Nambu-Goldstone mode of dilatation invariance.

To account for the vacuum choice ambiguity in cosmological settings, we introduce an arbitrary boundary action representing the initial conditions. RG flow in these spacetimes naturally affects the boundary interactions. As a consequence the boundary conditions are sensitive to high-energy physics through irrelevant terms in the boundary action. Using scalar field theory as an example, we derive the leading dimension four irrelevant boundary operators. We discuss how the known vacuum choices, e.g. the Bunch-Davies vacuum, appear in the Lagrangian description and square with decoupling. For all choices of boundary conditions encoded by relevant boundary operators, of which the known ones are a subset, backreaction is under control. All, moreover, will generically feel the influence of high-energy physics through irrelevant (dimension four) boundary corrections. Having established a coherent effective field theory framework including the vacuum choice ambiguity, we derive an explicit expression for the power spectrum of inflationary density perturbations including the leading high energy corrections.

At the same time, the optical conductivity ceases to be of Drude form at high temperatures, suggesting a change of the underlying dynamics that surprisingly leaves the $T$-linear DC-resistivity unaffected. We use the AdS/CFT correspondence that describes strongly coupled, densely entangled metals to study DC thermo-electrical transport and the optical conductivities of the local quantum critical Gubser-Rocha holographic strange metal in the presence of a lattice potential, a prime candidate to compare with experiment. We find that the DC-resistivity is linear in $T$ at low temperatures for a range of lattice strengths and wavevectors, even as it transitions between different dissipative regimes. At weak lattice potential the optical conductivity evolves with increasing temperature from a Drude form to a bad-metal characterized by a mid-IR resonance without changing the DC transport, similar to that seen in cuprate strange metals. This mid-IR peak and its temperature evolution can be understood as a consequence of Umklapp hydrodynamics: hydrodynamic perturbations are Bloch modes in the presence of a lattice. At strong lattice potential an incoherent metal is realized instead where momentum conservation no longer plays a role in transport. In this regime the thermal diffusivity can be explained by Planckian dissipation originating in universal microscopic chaos, similar to holographic metals with strong homogeneous momentum relaxation.

We review how the diffusive scale can be reached via a gradient expansion of the expectation values of the conserved fields and how the coefficients of the expansion can be computed via integrated steady-state two-point correlation functions, emphasising that PT-symmetry can fully fix the inherent ambiguity in the definition of conserved fields at the diffusive scale. We develop a form factor expansion to compute such correlation functions and we show that, while the dynamics at the Euler scale is completely determined by the density of single quasiparticle excitations on top of the local steady state, diffusion is due to scattering processes among quasiparticles, which are only present in truly interacting systems. We then show that only two-quasiparticle scattering processes contribute to the diffusive dynamics.

Similarly to the instability properties of hydrodynamic open flows, it is shown that $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking can be either absolute or convective. In the former case, an initially-localized wave packet shows a secular growth with time at any given spatial position, whereas in the latter case the growth is observed in a reference frame moving at some drift velocity while decay occurs at any fixed spatial position. In the convective unstable regime, $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is restored when the spatial region of gain/loss in the lattice is limited (rather than extended). We consider specifically a non-Hermitian extension of the Rice-Mele tight binding lattice model, and show the existence of a transition from absolute to convective symmetry breaking when the advective term is large enough. An extension of the analysis to ac-dc-driven lattices is also presented, and an optical implementation of the non-Hermitian Rice-Mele model is suggested, which is based on light transport in an array of evanescently-coupled optical waveguides with a periodically-bent axis and alternating regions of optical gain and loss.",2013-10-18 13:17:01+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevA.88.052102

In this work, we investigate details of pole-skipping purely from the point of view of classical gravity in 4d massive black hole geometries with flat, spherical and hyperbolic horizons, and with an arbitrary cosmological constant. We show that pole-skipping points naturally fall into two categories: the algebraically special points and a set of pole-skipping points that is common to the even and odd channels of perturbations. Our analysis utilises and generalises (to arbitrary maximally symmetric horizon topology and cosmological constant) the 'integrable' structure of the Darboux transformations, which relate the master field equations that describe the evolution of gravitational perturbations in the two channels.

The only flow away from the HK model is through the superconducting channel which lifts the spin degeneracy as does any ordering tendency. The superconducting instability is identical to that established previously\cite{nat1}. A corollary of this work is that Hubbard repulsive interactions flow into the HK stable fixed point in the vicinity of half-filling. Consequently, although the HK model has all-to-all interactions, nothing local destroys it. The consilience with Hubbard arises because both models break the $Z_2$ symmetry on a Fermi surface, the HK model being the simplest to do so.

1910.13696,"Quantum chaos, pole-skipping and hydrodynamics in a holographic system with chiral anomaly",Navid Abbasi ; Javad Tabatabaei,hep-th,hep-th,"It is well-known that chiral anomaly can be macroscopically detected through the energy and charge transport, due to the chiral magnetic effect. On the other hand, in a holographic many body system, the chaotic modes might be only associated with the energy conservation. This suggests that, perhaps, one can detect microscopic anomalies through the diagnosis of quantum chaos in such systems. To investigate this idea, we consider a magnetized brane in AdS space time with a Chern-Simons coupling in the bulk. By studying the shock wave geometry in this background, we first compute the corresponding butterfly velocities, in the presence of an external magnetic field $B$, in $\mu\ll T$ and $ B \ll T^2$ limit. We find that the butterfly propagation in the direction of $B$ has a different velocity than in the opposite direction. The splitting of butterfly velocities confirms the idea that chiral anomaly can be macroscopically manifested via quantum chaos. We then show that the pole-skipping points of energy density Green's function of the boundary theory coincide precisely with the chaos points. This might be regarded as the hydrodynamic origin of quantum chaos in an anomalous system. Additionally, by studying the near horizon dynamics of a scalar field on the above background, we find the spectrum of pole-skipping points associated with the two-point function of dual boundary operator. We find that the sum of wavenumbers corresponding to pole-skipping points at a specific Matsubara frequency is a universal quantity, which is independent of the scaling dimension of the dual boundary operator. We then show that this quantity follows from a closed formula and can be regarded as another macroscopic manifestation of the chiral anomaly.",2019-10-30 07:17:14+00:00,10.1007/JHEP03(2020)050

Type-III can arise at non-integer $i\omega$ values, which is due to a specific UV condition, contrary to the types I and II, which are related to a non-unique near-horizon boundary condition.

For this purpose, we apply the conjectured upper bound proposal related to the equilibration scales ($\omega_{\text{eq}}, k_{\text{eq}}$) to the Einstein-Maxwell-Axion model. ($\omega_{\text{eq}}, k_{\text{eq}}$) is defined as the collision point between the diffusive hydrodynamic mode and the first non-hydrodynamic mode, giving rise to the upper bound of the diffusion constant $D$ at low temperature $T$ as $D = \omega_{\text{eq}}/k_{\text{eq}}^2$. We show that the upper bound proposal also works for the charge diffusion and ($\omega_{\text{eq}}, k_{\text{eq}}$), at low $T$, is determined by $D$ and the scaling dimension $\Delta(0)$ of an infra-red operator as $(\omega_{\text{eq}}, \, k_{\text{eq}}^2) \,=\, (2 \pi T \Delta(0) \,, \omega_{\text{eq}}/D)$, as for other diffusion constants. However, for the charge diffusion, we find that the collision occurs at real $k_{\text{eq}}$, while it is complex for other diffusions. In order to examine the universality of the conjectured upper bound, we also introduce a higher derivative coupling to the Einstein-Maxwell-Axion model. This coupling is particularly interesting since it leads to the violation of the \textit{lower} bound of the charge diffusion constant so the correction may also have effects on the \textit{upper} bound of the charge diffusion. We find that the higher derivative coupling does not affect the upper bound so that the conjectured upper bound would not be easily violated.",2021-11-15 03:33:24+00:00,10.1007/JHEP07(2022)013

We revisit this formalism in theories with gauge symmetry and upgrade the pole-skipping condition so that it works without having to remove the gauge redundancy.

From a boundary perspective these `pole-skipping' points correspond to locations in the complex frequency and momentum planes at which a line of poles of the retarded Green's function intersects with a line of zeroes. As a consequence the dispersion relations of collective modes in the boundary theory at energy scales $\omega\sim T$ are directly constrained by the bulk dynamics near the black-brane horizon. For the case of conserved $U(1)$ current and energy-momentum tensor operators we give examples where the dispersion relations of hydrodynamic modes pass through a succession of pole-skipping points as real wavenumber is increased.

So far the chaotic behavior has been obtained through explicit calculations in specific models. In this paper we propose a unified description of the exponential growth and ballistic butterfly spreading of OTOCs across different systems using a newly formulated ""quantum hydrodynamics,"" which is valid at finite $\hbar$ and to all orders in derivatives. The scrambling of a generic few-body operator in a chaotic system is described as building up a ""hydrodynamic cloud,"" and the exponential growth of the cloud arises from a shift symmetry of the hydrodynamic action. The shift symmetry also shields correlation functions of the energy density and flux, and time ordered correlation functions of generic operators from exponential growth, while leads to chaotic behavior in OTOCs. The theory also predicts an interesting phenomenon of the skipping of a pole at special values of complex frequency and momentum in two-point functions of energy density and flux. This pole-skipping phenomenon may be considered as a ""smoking gun"" for the hydrodynamic origin of the chaotic mode.

An important question is to understand what is special about maximally chaotic systems which saturate this bound. Here we provide further evidence for the `hydrodynamic' origin of chaos in such systems, and discuss hallmarks of maximally chaotic systems. We first provide evidence that a hydrodynamic effective field theory of chaos we previously proposed should be understood as a theory of maximally chaotic systems. We then emphasize and make explicit a signature of maximal chaos which was only implicit in prior literature, namely the suppression of exponential growth in commutator squares of generic few-body operators. We provide a general argument for this suppression within our chaos effective field theory, and illustrate it using SYK models and holographic systems. We speculate that this suppression indicates that the nature of operator scrambling in maximally chaotic systems is fundamentally different to scrambling in non-maximally chaotic systems.

Further we show that this shock wave profile is directly related to the behaviour of energy fluctuations in the boundary theory. In particular, we demonstrate using the Teukolsky formalism that at complex frequency $\omega_* = i 2 \pi T$ there exists an extra ingoing solution to the linearised Einstein equations whenever the angular profile of metric perturbations near the horizon satisfies this shock wave equation. As a result, for metric perturbations with such temporal and angular profiles we find that the energy density response of the boundary theory exhibit the signatures of ""pole-skipping"" - namely, it is undefined, but exhibits a collective mode upon a parametrically small deformation of the profile.

The enhanced symmetry of such black holes allows us to provide a thorough examination of the phenomenon of pole-skipping, that is significantly simpler than a previous analysis of quantum field theory states dual to the Kerr-AdS$_4$ solution. In particular we give a general proof of pole-skipping in the retarded energy density Green's function of the dual quantum field theory whenever the spatial profile of energy fluctuations satisfies the shockwave equation governing the form of the OTOC. Furthermore, in the large black hole limit we are able to obtain a simple analytic expression for the OTOC for operator configurations on Hopf circles, and demonstrate that the associated Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity are robustly related to the locations of a family of pole-skipping points in the energy response. Finally, we note that in contrast to previous studies, our results are valid for any value of rotation and we are able to numerically demonstrate that the dispersion relations of sound modes in the energy response explicitly pass through our pole-skipping locations.",2022-10-31 18:00:01+00:00,10.1007/JHEP02(2023)253

In many models, the TEE takes a universal value that characterizes the underlying topological phase. However, the TEE is not truly universal: it can differ even for two states related by constant-depth circuits, which are necessarily in the same phase. The difference between the TEE and the value predicted by the anyon theory is often called the spurious topological entanglement entropy. We show that this spurious contribution is always nonnegative, thus the value predicted by the anyon theory provides a universal lower bound. This observation also leads to a definition of TEE that is invariant under constant-depth quantum circuits.",2023-02-01 19:00:03+00:00,10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.166601

When applied to conformal field theories at finite temperature, this fluctuation bound implies the Planckian bound. The fluctuation bound moreover applies to any local thermalizing system, and we study its implication for correlated insulators, metals, as well as disordered fixed points, where it can be used to establish a lower bound on the diffusivity in terms of the specific heat $D\gtrsim 1/(c_V^{2/d}\tau_{\rm eq})$.

In this work, we develop the topological holographic picture for (1+1)d quantum phases, including both gapped phases as well as a wide range of quantum critical points, including phase transitions between symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, symmetry enriched quantum critical points, deconfined quantum critical points and intrinsically gapless SPT phases.

The topological responses of the defect operators are also discussed in this framework.

These correspond to deformed cigar geometries in the Euclidean, glued to a pair of dynamical spacetimes in the Lorentzian.

We study the thermodynamics of this model both analytically and numerically, exposing the presence of algebraically decaying correlations and demonstrating an extensive ground state entropy, and give a comprehensive account of its ground state properties and excitations. Each classical ground state may be decomposed into collections of closed 2-dimensional membranes, supporting fractionalized string excitations attached to the boundaries of open membranes. At finite temperature, the model can then be described as a gas of closed strings in a background of fluctuating membranes. We demonstrate that the emergent gauge structure of the low-temperature phase is naturally captured in the formalism of 2-form electrodynamics, which describes 1-dimensional charged strings coupled to a rank-2 anti-symmetric gauge field. After establishing the classical spin vorticity model, we consider perturbing it with quantum exchange interactions, from which we derive an effective membrane exchange model of the quantum dynamics of these membranes, which maps to a frustrated 2-form U(1) lattice gauge theory. We show the existence of a fine-tuned Rokhsar-Kivelson point where the quantum ground state is an equal weight superposition of all classical ground state configurations. We further demonstrate how to quantize the string excitations, by coupling a 1-form string field to the emergent 2-form U(1) gauge field, thus mapping a quantum spin model to a 2-form gauge-Higgs model.

We review and extend known classical and semiclassical results on the interior chaos, formulated as both a dynamical system of `Kasner eras' and as a hyperbolic billiards problem. The volume of the universe collapses doubly-exponentially over each Kasner era. A remarkable feature is the emergence of a conserved energy, and hence a `time-independent' Hamiltonian, at asymptotically late interior times. A quantisation of this Hamiltonian exhibits arithmetic chaos associated with the principal congruence subgroup $\Gamma(2)$ of the modular group.

This provides a relativistic framework for the metric of a Riemmanian space with bosonic and fermionic coordinates, its continuum and discrete states, and a kind of {\it""quantum optics""} for the space-time. {\bf New} results of this paper are: (i) The space-time is described as a physical coherent state of the complete covering of the SL(2C) group, eg the Metaplectic group Mp(n). (ii) (The discrete structure arises from its two irreducible: $\textit{even}$ $(2n)$ and $\textit{odd}$ $(2n\;+\;1)\;$ representations, ($n = 1,\, 2, \,3\,...$ ), spanning the complete Hilbert space $\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}_{odd}\oplus \mathcal{H}_{even}$.

With the assumption of self-averaging randomness, similar to that in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, numerous observed properties of a strange metal were obtained for wide range of intermediate temperatures, including the linear-in-temperature resistivity. The Harris criterion implies that spatial fluctuations in the local position of the critical point must dominate at lower temperatures. For an $M$-component boson with $M \geq 2$, we use multiple graphics processing units (GPUs) to compute the real frequency spectrum of the boson propagator in a self-consistent mean-field treatment of the boson self-interactions, but an exact treatment of multiple realizations of the spatial randomness from the random boson mass. We find that Landau damping from the fermions leads to the emergence of the physics of the random transverse-field Ising model at low temperatures, as has been proposed by Hoyos, Kotabage, and Vojta. This regime is controlled by localized overdamped eigenmodes of the bosonic scalar field, also has a resistivity which is nearly linear-in-temperature, and extends into a `quantum critical phase' away from the quantum critical point, as observed in several cuprates. For the $M = 1$ Ising scalar, the mean-field treatment is not applicable, and so we use Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations running on multiple GPUs; we find a rounded transition and localization physics, with strange metal behavior in an extended region around the transition.",2023-12-11 19:00:00+00:00,10.1073/pnas.2402052121

Extending the result to finite (but long) times, we show that for fast scramblers, the K-complexity constrains the growth of generalised complexity more stringently than the dispersion bound.

We apply our method to the shear channel and find the branch cuts of a certain response function, without computing the response function itself.

We show that a certain class of gapless fractonic phases are realized as a result of spontaneous breaking of continuous higher-form symmetries whose conserved charges do not commute with spatial translations. We refer to such symmetries as nonuniform higher-form symmetries. These symmetries fall within the standard definition of higher-form symmetries in quantum field theory, and the corresponding symmetry generators are topological. Worldlines of particles are regarded as the charged objects of 1-form symmetries, and mobility restrictions can be implemented by introducing additional 1-form symmetries whose generators do not commute with spatial translations. These features are realized by effective field theories associated with spontaneously broken nonuniform 1-form symmetries. At low energies, the theories reduce to known higher-rank gauge theories such as scalar/vector charge gauge theories, and the gapless excitations in these theories are interpreted as Nambu--Goldstone modes for higher-form symmetries. Due to the nonuniformity of the symmetry, some of the modes acquire a gap, which is the higher-form analogue of the inverse Higgs mechanism of spacetime symmetries. The gauge theories have emergent nonuniform magnetic symmetries, and some of the magnetic monopoles become fractonic. We identify the 't~Hooft anomalies of the nonuniform higher-form symmetries and the corresponding bulk symmetry-protected topological phases. By this method, the mobility restrictions are fully determined by the choice of the commutation relations of charges with translations. This approach allows us to view existing (gapless) fracton models such as the scalar/vector charge gauge theories and their variants from a unified perspective and enables us to engineer theories with desired mobility restrictions.",2022-07-02 14:45:43+00:00,10.21468/SciPostPhys.16.2.050

Our approach considers the time evolution in the Krylov basis, which maps the dynamics onto that of a particle moving in a one-dimensional lattice where both the energy in the lattice sites and the tunneling from one lattice site to the next are inhomogeneous. By tying the dynamical propagation in the Krylov basis to that in the basis of microstates, we infer qualitative criteria to distinguish systems that remain localized close to their initial state from systems that undergo quantum thermalization. These criteria are system-dependent and involve the expectation values and standard deviations of both the coupling strengths between Krylov states and their energy. We verify their validity by inspecting two cases: Anderson localization as a function of dimension and the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a many-body dipolar spin system. We finally investigate the Wigner surmise and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which have both been proposed to characterize quantum chaotic systems. We show that when the average value of the non-diagonal terms in the Lanczos matrix is large compared to their fluctuations and to the fluctuations of the energy expectation values, which typically corresponds to delocalized quantum systems according to our criteria, there can be level repulsion of eigen-energies (also known as spectral rigidity), similar to that of the Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy levels; and we also demonstrate that in the same regime, the expectation values of typical local observables only weakly vary as a function of eigenstates, an important condition for the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Our demonstration assumes that, in the chaotic regime, the observable is sufficiently diagonal in the basis of Krylov states.",2023-07-20 08:55:02+00:00,10.48550/2307.10706

The scheme is based on the generalised harmonic formulation of the Einstein equations. The main difficulty in removing all symmetry assumptions can be phrased in terms of finding a set of generalised harmonic source functions that are consistent with the AdS boundary conditions. I detail a prescription to obtain the set of source functions that achieves stable evolution in full generality. This prescription leads to the first long-time stable 3+1 simulations of four dimensional spacetimes with a negative cosmological constant in Cartesian coordinates. I show results of gravitational collapse with no symmetry assumptions, and the subsequent ringdown to a static black hole in the bulk, which corresponds to evolution towards a homogeneous state on the boundary. Furthermore, it is argued that this scheme is well-suited for the study of black hole superradiance -- the amplification of waves scattering off a rotating black hole -- in Kerr-AdS spacetime. This statement is supported by the results of a preliminary simulation of perturbed Kerr-AdS.",2022-05-30 18:00:01+00:00,10.48550/2205.15329

Such a model can be constructed in the AdS/CFT correspondence by gluing a bath on the asymptotic boundary of the bulk anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. This bath models a laboratory and is described by a quantum field theory. In the dual conformal field theory (CFT) description this coupling is achieved by a double-trace deformation that couples the CFT with the bath. This suggests that the physics observed by the laboratory is fully unitary. In this paper, we analyze the quantum aspects of this model in detail which conveys new lessons about the AdS/CFT correspondence, and we discuss the potential usefulness of this model in understanding subregion physics in a gravitational universe.",2023-11-22 19:00:00+00:00,10.48550/2311.13633

We find a suppression of the Fano factor in the strange metal, and describe the dependence of the shot noise on temperature and applied voltage. At low temperatures, we obtain a Fano factor equal to $1/6$, in contrast to the $1/3$ Fano factor in diffusive metals with quasiparticles. Our results are in general agreement with recent observations by Chen et al. (arXiv:2206.00673).

The flows are obtained by deforming a holographic conformal field theory with a relevant operator, altering the interior geometry from AdS-Schwarzschild to a more general Kasner universe near the spacelike singularity. We introduce null matter in the form of a shock wave into this geometry and scrutinize its impact on the near-horizon and interior dynamics of the black hole. Using out-of-time-order correlators, we find that the scrambling time increases as we increase the strength of the deformation, whereas the butterfly velocity displays a non-monotonic behavior. We examine other observables that are more sensitive to the black hole interior, such as the thermal $a$-function and the entanglement velocity. Notably, the $a$-function experiences a discontinuous jump across the shock wave, signaling an instantaneous loss of degrees of freedom due to the infalling matter. This jump is interpreted as a `cosmological time skip' which arises from an infinitely boosted length contraction. The entanglement velocity exhibits similar dependence to the butterfly velocity as we vary the strength of the deformation. Lastly, we extend our analyses to a model where the interior geometry undergoes an infinite sequence of bouncing Kasner epochs.",2023-11-21 19:03:36+00:00,10.48550/2311.12940

This expectation is validated for certain cases, however, we make a noteworthy observation: for a specific scenario where $-1<\gamma \leq -1/3$, with $\gamma$ as a coupling parameter, it is not the HEE itself but rather the second-order derivative of HEE with respect to the lattice wave number that effectively characterizes quantum phase transitions (QPTs). This distinction arises due to the influence of thermal effects.

To illustrate this approach, we consider several one-dimensional systems, including the quantum cat map, and three paradigmatic large-$N$ models, including the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.

In this paper, we revisit the possibility of understanding strongly coupled metals through a holographic duality with a weakly coupled gravitational theory in one higher dimension (i.e.\ a suitable generalization of the ""AdS/CFT duality"". Previous attempts at devising holographic models of strongly coupled metals have suffered from severe drawbacks; for example, they do not even seem to be able to describe a Fermi surface that satisfies Luttinger's theorem, which is ought to be a core requirement in any physically reasonable model of a metal. Here, we propose a radically different approach to constructing holographic models of strongly coupled metals. The idea is that for applications, it should be sufficient to construct a holographic dual of the effective field theory that controls the infra-red physics of the metal. We invoke recent work that has identified a precise criterion for such an effective field theory to be ""emergeable"" from a continuum ultra-violet (UV) theory at nonzero charge density (or its equivalent in lattice models, namely an incommensurate charge filling). We show that imposing this criterion leads to a holographic model of a strongly coupled metal with physically reasonable properties, including a Fermi surface satisfying Luttinger's theorem.

In addition, different forms of state preparation are investigated: analytic or exact diagonalization techniques, adiabatic algorithms (with and without shortcuts), and Quantum Variational Eigensolvers. We find that the divergence (or lack thereof) of the complexity near a phase transition depends on the non-local character of the operations used to reach the ground state. For Fubini-Study based complexity, we extract the universal properties and their critical exponents. In practical algorithms, we find that the complexity depends crucially on whether or not the system passes close to a quantum critical point when preparing the state.

In this article we discuss what it means to gauge a spacetime inversion symmetry, and we explain some of the more unusual consequences of doing this. In particular we argue that the gauging of $\mathcal{CRT}$ is automatically implemented by the sum over topologies in the Euclidean gravity path integral, that in a closed universe the Hilbert space of quantum gravity must be a real vector space, and that in Lorentzian signature manifolds which are not time-orientable must be included as valid configurations of the theory.

Specifically, we find analytical expressions for these signatures in paradigmatic models of quantum chaos, namely the three Gaussian ensembles of random matrix theory, and in integrable models, taken as systems with completely uncorrelated spectra (the Poissonian ensemble). The spectral distance decomposition of the SFF allows us to probe the contribution of each individual $k$nLS to the ramp.

It has previously been argued that an infinite-dimensional emergent symmetry group is such a property, at least for clean, compressible metals. In this paper, we will show that such an emergent symmetry group has very strong implications for the dynamics of the metal. Specifically, we show that consideration of the hydrodynamics of the associated infinitely many emergent conserved quantities automatically recovers the collisionless Boltzmann equation that governs the dynamics of a Fermi liquid. Therefore, the hydrodynamic prediction is that in the low-temperature, collisionless regime where the emergent conservation laws hold, the dynamics and response to external fields of a general spinless metal will be identical to a Fermi liquid.

We show that if $\nu$ is fractional (i.e. not an integer), this imposes very strong constraints on the low-energy theory of the system and give a framework to understand such constraints in great generality, vastly generalizing the Luttinger and Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems. The most powerful constraint comes about if $\nu$ is continuously tunable (i.e. the system is charge-compressible), in which case we show that the low-energy theory must have a very large emergent symmetry group -- larger than any compact Lie group. An example is the Fermi surface of a Fermi liquid, where the charge at every point on the Fermi surface is conserved. We expect that in many, if not all, cases, even exotic non-Fermi liquids will have the same emergent symmetry group as a Fermi liquid, even though they could have very different dynamics. We call a system with this property an ""ersatz Fermi liquid"". We show that ersatz Fermi liquids share a number of properties in common with Fermi liquids, including Luttinger's theorem (which is thus extended to a large class of non-Fermi liquids) and periodic ""quantum oscillations"" in the response to an applied magnetic field. We also establish versions of Luttinger's theorem for the composite Fermi liquid in quantum Hall systems and for spinon Fermi surfaces in Mott insulators.

This SYK-like physics includes power-law correlation functions and an extensive low temperature entropy, so we refer to the model as Spin SYK. The model is generic in that it includes all possible $q$-body couplings, lacks most symmetries, and has no spatial structure, so our results can be construed as establishing a certain ubiquity of quantum holography in systems dominated by many-body interactions. Furthermore, we discuss a generalized family of models which includes Spin SYK and which provably exhibit SYK-like physics in the solvable limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. We also comment on implications of a bosonic system with SYK-like properties for the study of holography, Hamiltonian complexity, and related topics.",2023-11-02 18:04:10+00:00,10.48550/2311.01516
