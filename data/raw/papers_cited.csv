Measuring the dynamic charge response of the copper-oxides, $\chi''(q,\omega)$, would directly reveal the collective properties of the strange metal, but it has never been possible to measure this quantity with meV resolution. Here, we present the first measurement of $\chi''(q,\omega)$ for a cuprate, optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ ($T_c=91$ K), using momentum-resolved inelastic electron scattering. In the medium energy range 0.1-2 eV relevant to the strange metal, the spectra are dominated by a featureless, temperature- and momentum-independent continuum persisting to the eV energy scale. This continuum displays a simple power law form, exhibiting $q^2$ behavior at low energy and $q^2/\omega^2$ behavior at high energy. Measurements of an overdoped crystal ($T_c=50$ K) showed the emergence of a gap-like feature at low temperature, indicating deviation from power law form outside the strange metal regime. Our study suggests the strange metal exhibits a new type of charge dynamics in which excitations are local to such a degree that space and time axes are decoupled.","2018-05-22","2021-07-22 12:22:28","2024-02-18 13:42:10","2021-07-22 12:22:28","5392-5396","","21","115","","Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","78 citations (CrossRef 2024/2/18) tex.ids= mitrano2018a, mitranoAnomalousDensityFluctuations2018 arXiv: 1708.01929 tex.copyright: © 2018 . http://www.pnas.org/site/aboutpnas/licenses.xhtmlPublished under the PNAS license. tex.eprint: 1708.01929 PMID: 29735712 publisher: National Academy of Sciences section: Physical Sciences","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/BQRQERM8/mitrano2018.pdf","","cuprates; electron energy-loss spectroscopy; non-Fermi liquid; quantum criticality; strange metal","⛔ No INSPIRE recid found; Condensed Matter - Materials Science; Condensed Matter - Strongly Correlated Electrons; Condensed Matter - Superconductivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal is to explain in a language that can be understood by non-specialists very recent advances in quantum information and especially string theory suggesting the existence of entirely new forms of matter. These are metallic states characterized by an extremely dense many body entanglement, requiring the supremacy of the quantum computer to be completely enumerated. The holographic duality discovered in string theory appears to be a mathematical machinery capable of computing observable properties of such matter, suggesting the presence of universal general principles governing its phenomenology.

In the first part, ETH is introduced as a natural extension of ideas from quantum chaos and random matrix theory (RMT). To this end, we present a brief overview of classical and quantum chaos, as well as RMT and some of its most important predictions. The latter include the statistics of energy levels, eigenstate components, and matrix elements of observables. Building on these, we introduce the ETH and show that it allows one to describe thermalization in isolated chaotic systems without invoking the notion of an external bath. We examine numerical evidence of eigenstate thermalization from studies of many-body lattice systems. We also introduce the concept of a quench as a means of taking isolated systems out of equilibrium, and discuss results of numerical experiments on quantum quenches. The second part of the review explores the implications of quantum chaos and ETH to thermodynamics. Basic thermodynamic relations are derived, including the second law of thermodynamics, the fundamental thermodynamic relation, fluctuation theorems, and the Einstein and Onsager relations. In particular, it is shown that quantum chaos allows one to prove these relations for individual Hamiltonian eigenstates and thus extend them to arbitrary stationary statistical ensembles. We then show how one can use these relations to obtain nontrivial universal energy distributions in continuously driven systems. At the end of the review, we briefly discuss the relaxation dynamics and description after relaxation of integrable quantum systems, for which ETH is violated. We introduce the concept of the generalized Gibbs ensemble, and discuss its connection with ideas of prethermalization in weakly interacting systems.","2016-07-31","2022-10-27 08:37:05","2024-02-18 13:42:22","2022-10-27 08:37:04","239-362","","3","65","","Adv.

We illustrate the use of these methods by studying localized black holes and non-uniform black strings in five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory, improving on previous calculations of their thermodynamic and geometric properties. We study spectra of various operators for these solutions, in particular finding negative modes of the Lichnerowicz operator. We classify the localized solutions into two branches that meet at a minimum temperature. We find good evidence for a merger between the localized and non-uniform solutions.

For static black holes analytically continued to Riemannian manifolds without boundary at the horizon this equation has previously been shown to be elliptic, and Ricci flow and Newton's method provide good numerical algorithms to solve it. Here we extend these techniques to the arbitrary cohomogeneity stationary case which must be treated in Lorentzian signature. For stationary spacetimes with globally timelike Killing vector the Harmonic Einstein equation is elliptic. In the presence of horizons and ergo-regions it is less obviously so. Motivated by the Rigidity theorem we study a class of stationary black hole spacetimes, considered previously by Harmark, general enough to include the asymptotically flat case in higher dimensions. We argue the Harmonic Einstein equation consistently truncates to this class of spacetimes giving an elliptic problem. The Killing horizons and axes of rotational symmetry are boundaries for this problem and we determine boundary conditions there. As a simple example we numerically construct 4D rotating black holes in a cavity using Anderson's boundary conditions. We demonstrate both Newton's method and Ricci flow to find these Lorentzian solutions.","2012","2022-10-27 08:45:53","2024-02-18 13:42:37","2022-10-27 08:45:52","165002","","16","29","","Class.

We show that random field disorder has a strong effect on resistivity: charge carriers in the infrared are easily depleted, as the relaxation time for momentum is surprisingly small. In the course of our holographic calculation we use a non-trivial dilaton coupling to the disordered scalar, allowing us to study a strongly-coupled scale invariant theory with $\theta \ne 0$.

In the vicinity of a quantum critical point, thermodynamics and transport in the system are expected to be controlled by the critical exponents and by the spectrum of irrelevant deformations away from the quantum critical point. Here, using gauge-gravity duality, we present the low temperature dependence of thermodynamic and charge transport coefficients at first order in the hydrodynamic derivative expansion in terms of the critical exponents. Special attention will be paid to the behavior of the charge density of the normal flow in systems with emergent infrared conformal and Lifshitz symmetries, parameterized by a Lifshitz dynamical exponent $z>1$. When $1\leq z<d+2$, we recover ($z=1$) and extend ($z>1$) previous results obtained by relativistic effective field theory techniques. Instead, when $z>d+2$, we show that the normal charge density becomes non-vanishing at zero temperature.

Upon breaking translations spontaneously, new gapless collective modes emerge, the Nambu-Goldstone bosons of broken translations. When translations are also weakly broken (eg by disorder or lattice effects), these phonons are pinned with a mass $m$ and damped at a rate $\Omega$, which we explicitly compute. This contribution to $\Omega$ is distinct from that of topological defects. We show that $\Omega\simeq G m^2\Xi$, where $G$ is the shear modulus and $\Xi$ is related to a diffusivity of the purely spontaneous state. This result follows from the smallness of the bulk and shear moduli, as would be the case in a phase with fluctuating translational order. At low temperatures, the collective modes relax quickly into the heat current, so that late time transport is dominated by the thermal diffusivity. In this regime, the resistivity in our model is linear in temperature and the ac conductivity displays a significant rearranging of the degrees of freedom, as spectral weight is shifted from an off-axis, pinning peak to a Drude-like peak. These results could shed light on transport properties in cuprate high $T_c$ superconductors, where quantum critical behavior and translational order occur over large parts of the phase diagram and transport shows qualitatively similar features.","2019-11-20","2022-10-27 08:53:46","2023-09-12 13:18:53","","211602","","21","123","","Phys.

We find that the results of the two computations have significant qualitative similarities. However, differences do appear in the vicinities of an infinite discrete set of values of $V/k$: the universality class of the infrared CFT changes at these values in the weakly-coupled theory, by the emergence of new zero modes of Dirac fermions which are remnants of local Fermi surfaces.

We verify numerically that, in holographic systems with momentum dissipation, the viscosity to entropy bound might be violated but the shear diffusion constant remains bounded by below. This confirms the idea that $\eta/s$ loses its privileged role in non-relativistic systems and that, in order to find more universal bounds, one should rather look at diffusion constants. We strengthen this idea by showing that, in presence of spontaneously broken translations, the Goldstone diffusion constant satisfies a universal lower bound in terms of the Planckian relaxation time and the butterfly velocity. Additionally, all the diffusive processes in the model satisfy an upper bound, imposed by causality, which is given in terms of the thermalization time -- the imaginary part of the first non-hydrodynamic mode in the spectrum -- and the speed of longitudinal sound. Finally, we discuss the existence of a bound on the speed of sound in holographic conformal solids and we show that the conformal value acts as a lower (and not upper) bound on the speed of longitudinal phonons. Nevertheless, we show that the stiffness $\partial p/\partial \epsilon$ is still bounded by above by its conformal value. This suggests that the bounds conjectured in the past have to be considered on the stiffness of the system, related to its equation of state, and not on the propagation speed of sound.","2020-07-15","2023-08-09 07:40:17","2023-09-12 13:18:49","2023-08-09 07:40:17","007","","1","9","","SciPost Phys.","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1796393","DOI.org (Crossref)","","33 citations (INSPIRE 2023/9/12) 21 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2023/9/12) Citation Key: Baggioli:2020ljz tex.ids= baggioliUniversalBoundsTransport2020 arXiv:2005.06482 [hep-th]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/M3LJ5H3Y/Baggioli2020ljz.pdf","","Condensed Matter - Disordered Systems and Neural Networks; Condensed Matter - Strongly Correlated Electrons; High Energy Physics - Theory; Quantum Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this scenario we show the validity of a universal relation, found in the context of translational symmetry breaking, between the phase relaxation rate, the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone and the Goldstone diffusivity.","2022-03-02","2023-09-12 13:05:05","2024-02-18 13:41:22","","015","","3","03","","JHEP","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1972108","","","26 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 16 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: Ammon:2021pyz arXiv:2111.10305 [hep-th]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/RNRUJZ3S/Ammon2021pyz.pdf","","Condensed Matter - Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics; Condensed Matter - Strongly Correlated Electrons; High Energy Physics - Theory; Nuclear Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In metals with sharp Drude peaks, the relevant physics is correctly organized around the slow relaxation of almost-conserved momenta. While in Fermi liquids both currents and momenta relax slowly, due to the weakness of interactions among low energy excitations, in strongly interacting non-Fermi liquids typically only momenta relax slowly. It follows that the conductivities of such non-Fermi liquids are obtained within a fundamentally different kinematics to Fermi liquids. Among these strongly interacting non-Fermi liquids we distinguish cases with only one almost-conserved momentum, which we term hydrodynamic metals, and with many patchwise almost-conserved momenta. For all these cases, we obtain universal expressions for the ratio of conductivities that violate the Wiedemann-Franz law. We further discuss the case in which long-lived `cold' quasiparticles, in general with unconventional scattering rates, coexist with strongly interacting hot spots, lines or bands. For these cases, we characterize circumstances under which non-Fermi liquid transport, in particular a linear in temperature resistivity, is and is not compatible with the Wiedemann-Franz law. We suggest the likely outcome of future transport experiments on CeCoIn5, YbRh2Si2 and Sr3Ru2O7 at their critical magnetic fields.","2013-09-05","2023-09-12 13:05:04","2024-02-18 13:42:32","","125107","","12","88","","Phys.

The saddle point equations of this model are similar to appoximate dynamic mean field equations of realistic, non-random, $t$-$J$ models. We use numerical studies on both real and imaginary frequency axes, along with asymptotic analyses, to establish the existence of a critical non-Fermi-liquid metallic ground state at large doping, with the spin correlation exponent varying with doping. This critical solution possesses a time-reparametrization symmetry, akin to SYK models, which contributes a linear-in-temperature resistivity over the full range of doping where the solution is present. It is therefore an attractive mean-field description of the overdoped region of cuprates, where experiments have observed a linear-$T$ resistivity in a broad region. The critical metal also displays a strong particle-hole asymmetry, which is relevant to Seebeck coefficient measurements. We show that the critical metal has an instability to a low-doping spin-glass phase, and compute a critical doping value.

As a result, it is part of the reason fields such as ultra-cold atomic physics are so exciting: they can provide quantum emulators of models that could not otherwise be solved, due to the SP. For the same reason, it is also one of the primary motivations behind quantum computation. It is often argued that the SP is not intrinsic to the physics of particular Hamiltonians, since the details of how it onsets, and its eventual occurrence, can be altered by the choice of algorithm or many-particle basis. Despite that, we show that the SP in determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) is quantitatively linked to quantum critical behavior. We demonstrate this via simulations of a number of fundamental models of condensed matter physics, including the spinful and spinless Hubbard Hamiltonians on a honeycomb lattice and the ionic Hubbard Hamiltonian, all of whose critical properties are relatively well understood. We then propose a reinterpretation of the low average sign for the Hubbard model on the square lattice when away from half-filling, an important open problem in condensed matter physics, in terms of the onset of pseudogap behavior and exotic superconductivity. Our study charts a path for exploiting the average sign in QMC simulations to understand quantum critical behavior, rather than solely as an obstacle that prevents quantum simulations of many-body Hamiltonians at low temperature.","2022-01","2023-09-12 13:05:05","2024-02-18 13:41:26","","418–424","","6579","375","","arXiv:2108.08974 [cond-mat.str-el]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1908964","","","16 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 10 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: Mondaini:2021ywk Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science tex.eprint: 2108.08974 arXiv:2108.08974 [cond-mat.str-el]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/TPX3768Z/Mondaini2021ywk.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What seems to be missing is an additional length scale, which may or may not be critical. Second, we prove a generalised version of Luttinger's theorem for a Mott insulator. Namely, regardless of the spatial dimension, the Fermi surface of the non-interacting system is converted into a surface of zeros of the single-particle Green function when the Mott insulator posesses particle-hole symmetry. Only in the presence of particle-hole symmetry does the volume of the surface of zeros equal the particle density.

The mysterious strange metal is characterized by non-Boltzmann transport and violates most fundamental Fermi-liquid scaling laws. A fundamental question is, do strange metals have plasmons? Using momentum-resolved inelastic electron scattering, we recently showed that, rather than a plasmon, optimally doped Bi2.1Sr1.9Ca1.0Cu2.0O8+x (Bi-2212) exhibits a featureless, temperature-independent continuum with a power-law form over most energy and momentum scales [M. Mitrano et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 115, 5392 (2018)]. Here, we show that this continuum is present throughout the fan-shaped, strange metal region of the phase diagram. Outside this region, dramatic changes in spectral weight are observed: In underdoped samples, spectral weight up to 0.5 eV is enhanced at low temperature, biasing the system toward a charge order instability. The situation is reversed in the overdoped case, where spectral weight is strongly suppressed at low temperature, increasing quasiparticle coherence in this regime. Optimal doping corresponds to the boundary between these two opposite behaviors at which the response is temperature independent. Our study suggests that plasmons do not exist as well-defined excitations in Bi-2212 and that a featureless continuum is a defining property of the strange metal, which is connected to a peculiar crossover where the spectral weight change undergoes a sign reversal.","2019-12-26","2022-10-27 08:59:15","2024-02-18 13:41:55","2022-10-27 08:59:14","041062","","4","9","","Phys.

We use the Seebeck coefficient as a probe of the particle-hole asymmetry of the electronic structure across the pseudogap critical doping p⋆=0.23. Outside the pseudogap phase, at p=0.24>p⋆, we observe a positive and essentially isotropic Seebeck coefficient as T→0. That S>0 at p=0.24 is at odds with expectations given the electronic band structure of Nd-LSCO above p⋆ and its known electronlike Fermi surface. We can reconcile this observation by invoking an energy-dependent scattering rate with a particle-hole asymmetry, possibly rooted in the non-Fermi-liquid nature of cuprates just above p⋆. Inside the pseudogap phase, for p<p⋆, Sa is seen to rise at low temperature as previously reported, consistent with the drop in carrier density n from n≃1+p to n≃p across p⋆ as inferred from other transport properties. In stark contrast, Sc at low temperature becomes negative below p⋆, a novel signature of the pseudogap phase. The sudden drop in Sc reveals a change in the electronic structure of Nd-LSCO upon crossing p⋆. We can exclude a profound change of the scattering across p⋆ and conclude that the change in the out-of-plane Seebeck coefficient originates from a transformation of the Fermi surface.","2022-02-25","2022-10-27 09:00:41","2024-02-18 13:41:23","2022-10-27 09:00:41","011037","","1","12","","Phys.

The most discussed of such properties is the linear in temperature resistivity down to asymptotically low temperatures, sometimes called Planckian resistivity, above the region of the highest Tc. Similar anomalies have since also been discovered in the heavy-fermion compounds and in the Fe-based superconducting metals, and most recently in twisted bilayer graphene. Innumerable papers in the past three decades have pointed out that the linear in T resistivity and associated properties are a mystery and the most important unsolved problem in condensed matter physics; superconductivity itself is a corollary to the normal state properties. Even in this prolifically investigated field, quantitative experimental results on crucial normal state and superconducting state properties have only recently become available. It is now possible to compare some of the detailed predictions of a theory for the normal and superconductive state in cuprates and in heavy fermions with the experiments. The theory gives the frequency and temperature dependence of various normal state properties and also their measured magnitudes in terms of the same values of two parameters. It also resolves the paradox of d-wave symmetry of superconductivity in the cuprates given that the scattering rate of fermions in the normal state is nearly momentum independent. The same parameters that govern the normal state anomalies are also deduced from the quantitative analysis of data in the superconducting state in cuprates. The simplicity of the results depends on the discovery of a new class of quantum-critical fluctuation in which orthogonal topological excitations in space and time determine the spectra, such that the correlations of the critical spectra are a product of a function of space and a function of time with the spatial correlation length proportional to the logarithm of the temporal correlation length. The fermions scattering with such fluctuations form a marginal Fermi liquid.","2020-07-07","2022-10-27 08:41:48","2024-02-18 13:41:48","2022-10-27 08:41:47","031001","","3","92","","Rev. Mod.

Detected originally through high magnetic field, transport experiments, signatures of this phase have now been uncovered with a variety of probes. Our high resolution optical data of the low T$_{c}$ cuprate superconductor, Bi$_{2-x}$Pb$_{x}$Sr$_{2-y}$La$_{y}$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ allows us to probe this phase over a large energy and temperature window. We demonstrate that the optical signatures of the strange metal phase persist throughout the phase diagram. The strange metal signatures in the optical conductivity are two-fold, (i): a low energy Drude response with Drude width on the order of temperature and (ii): a high energy conformal tail with doping dependent power-law exponent. While the Drude weight evolves monotonously throughout the entire doping range studied, the spectral weight contained in the high energy conformal tail appears to be doping and temperature independent. Our analysis further shows that the temperature dependence of the optical conductivity is completely determined by the Drude parameters. Our results indicate that there is no critical doping level inside the superconducting dome where the carrier density starts to change drastically and that the previously observed 'return to normalcy' is a consequence of the increasing importance of the Drude component relative to the conformal tail with doping. Importantly, both the doping and temperature dependence of the resistivity are largely determined by the Drude width.","2022-08-01","2022-10-27 08:34:28","2024-02-18 13:41:14","2022-10-27 08:34:27","054515","","5","106","","Phys.

We show that near a class of strongly interacting quantum critical points that arise in the infra-red limit of translationally invariant holographic theories, there is a collective excitation (a quasinormal mode of the dual black hole spacetime) whose lifetime $\tau_{eq}$ is parametrically longer than $\tau_P$: $\tau_{eq}\gg T^{-1}$. The lifetime is enhanced due to its dependence on a dangerously irrelevant coupling that breaks the particle-hole symmetry and the invariance under Lorentz boosts of the quantum critical point. The thermal diffusivity (in units of the butterfly velocity) is anomalously large near the quantum critical point and is governed by $\tau_{eq}$ rather than $\tau_P$. We conjecture that there exists a long-lived, propagating collective mode with velocity $v_s$, and in this case the relation $D=v_s^2\tau_{eq}$ holds exactly in the limit $T\tau_{eq}\gg1$. While scale invariance is broken, a generalised scaling theory still holds provided that the dependence of observables on the dangerously irrelevant coupling is incorporated. Our work further underlines the connection between dangerously irrelevant deformations and slow equilibration.","2019-10-05","2022-04-01 08:36:42","2024-02-18 13:41:59","2022-04-01 08:36:42","141601","","14","123","","Phys.

Here we provide direct imaging of the Poiseuille flow of an electronic fluid, as well as a visualization of its evolution from ballistic flow. Using a scanning carbon nanotube single-electron transistor12, we image the Hall voltage of electronic flow through channels of high-mobility graphene. We find that the profile of the Hall field across the channel is a key physical quantity for distinguishing ballistic from hydrodynamic flow. We image the transition from flat, ballistic field profiles at low temperatures into parabolic field profiles at elevated temperatures, which is the hallmark of Poiseuille flow. The curvature of the imaged profiles is qualitatively reproduced by Boltzmann calculations, which allow us to create a ‘phase diagram’ that characterizes the electron flow regimes.

Such theories are parameterized by two real exponents $(\gamma,\delta)$ that control the IR dynamics. By studying the thermodynamics, spectra and conductivities of several classes of charged dilatonic black hole solutions that include the charge density back reaction fully, the landscape of such theories in view of condensed matter applications is characterized. Several regions of the $(\gamma,\delta)$ plane can be excluded as the extremal solutions have unacceptable singularities. The classical solutions have generically zero entropy at zero temperature, except when $\gamma=\delta$ where the entropy at extremality is finite. The general scaling of DC resistivity with temperature at low temperature, and AC conductivity at low frequency and temperature across the whole $(\gamma,\delta)$ plane, is found. There is a codimension-one region where the DC resistivity is linear in the temperature.

It has been shown that $D_T/(v_B^2 \tau_L)$ is universal in some holographic models as well as condensed matter systems including the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. We investigate to what extent this relation is universal in the Q-lattice models with infrared (IR) scaling geometry, focusing on the effect of spatial anisotropy. Indeed it was shown that $\mathcal{E}_i := D_{T,i}/(v_{B,i}^2 \tau_L)$ ($i=x,y$) is determined only by some scaling exponents of the IR metric in the low temperature limit regardless of the matter fields and ultraviolet data. Inspired by this observation, in this work, we find the concrete expressions for $\mathcal{E}_i$ in terms of the critical dynamical exponents $z_i$ in each direction. By analyzing the IR scaling geometry we identify the allowed scaling parameter regimes, which enable us to compute the allowed range of $\mathcal{E}_i$.

The black hole we study has a simple analytic form because it can be embedded in type IIB string theory as the near-horizon limit of D3-branes with equal spins in two of the three independent transverse planes. Two further properties can be deduced from this embedding: There is a thermodynamic instability, reminiscent of ferromagnetism, at low temperatures/ and there is an AdS_3 factor in the extremal near-horizon geometry which accounts for the linear dependence of entropy on temperature. Altogether, it is plausible that the dilatonic black hole we study, or a relative of it with similar behavior in the infrared, is the dual of a Fermi liquid/ however, the particular embedding in string theory that we consider is unlikely to have such a dual description, unless through some unexpected boson-fermion equivalence at large N.","2010","2023-09-12 13:05:04","2024-02-18 13:42:44","","046001","","4","81","","Phys.

In Fermi liquids with a large Fermi surface and weak electron-impurity scattering, we provide universal and simple formulas for the behavior of the thermoelectric conductivities across the ballistic-to-hydrodynamic crossover. In this regime, the electrical conductivity is relatively unchanged by hydrodynamic effects. In contrast, the thermal conductivity can be parametrically smaller than predicted by the Wiedemann-Franz law. A less severe violation of the Mott law arises. We quantitatively compare the violations of the Wiedemann-Franz law arising from (i) momentum-conserving electron-electron scattering in the collision integral, (ii) hydrodynamic modifications of the electron-impurity scattering rate, and (iii) thermal broadening of the Fermi surface, and show that (i) is the largest. We present simple formulas for electrical and thermal magnetoconductivity across the ballistic-to-hydrodynamic limit, along with a more complicated formula for the thermoelectric magnetoconductivity. In a finite magnetic field, the Lorenz number may be smaller or larger than predicted by the Wiedemann-Franz law, and the crossover between these behaviors is a clear prediction for experiments. The arbitrarily strong violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law found in our work arises entirely from electron-electron interaction effects within the Fermi liquid paradigm, and does not imply any non-Fermi liquid behavior. We predict clear experimental signatures of bulk hydrodynamics in high-mobility 2D GaAs semiconductor structures, where failure of the Wiedemann-Franz law should persist down to very low temperatures in high-quality, low-density samples.","2018-06-23","2023-09-12 13:05:05","2024-02-18 13:42:09","","245128","","24","97","","Phys.

This paper investigates many of the basic geometric objects associated to this space, including the Levi-Civita connection, the geodesic equation, the curvature, and the Jacobi equation. We show that the optimal Hamiltonian evolution for synthesis of a desired unitary necessarily obeys a simple universal geodesic equation. As a consequence, once the initial value of the Hamiltonian is set, subsequent changes to the Hamiltonian are completely determined by the geodesic equation. We develop many analytic solutions to the geodesic equation, and a set of invariants that completely determine the geodesics. We investigate the problem of finding minimal geodesics through a desired unitary, U, and develop a procedure which allows us to deform the (known) geodesics of a simple and well understood metric to the geodesics of the metric of interest in quantum computation. This deformation procedure is illustrated using some three-qubit numerical examples. We study the computational complexity of evaluating distances on Riemmanian manifolds, and show that no efficient classical algorithm for this problem exists, subject to the assumption that good pseudorandom generators exist. Finally, we develop a canonical extension procedure for unitary operations which allows ancilla qubits to be incorporated into the geometric approach to quantum computing.","2008","2023-09-12 13:24:13","2024-02-18 13:42:49","","0861-0899","","10","8","","Quant.

We conclude using the CV conjecture that the rate of change of complexity is a monotonically increasing function of time, which saturates from below to a positive constant in the late time limit. Using the CA conjecture for uncharged black holes, the holographic complexity remains constant for an initial period, then briefly decreases but quickly begins to increase. As observed previously, at late times, the rate of growth of the complexity approaches a constant, which may be associated with Lloyd's bound on the rate of computation. However, we find that this late time limit is approached from above, thus violating the bound. Adding a charge to the eternal black holes washes out the early time behaviour, i.e., complexity immediately begins increasing with sufficient charge, but the late time behaviour is essentially the same as in the neutral case. We also evaluate the complexity of formation for charged black holes and find that it is divergent for extremal black holes, implying that the states at finite chemical potential and zero temperature are infinitely more complex than their finite temperature counterparts.","2017-11-28","2023-09-12 13:24:14","2024-02-18 13:42:13","","188","","","11","","JHEP","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1627859","","","278 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 251 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: Carmi:2017jqz arXiv:1709.10184 [hep-th]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/UBH84DKJ/Carmi2017jqz.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we find the solutions for extremal and near extremal branes through a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. The near horizon geometries in the simplest cases, where $f(\phi) = e^{\alpha\phi}$, are Lifshitz-like, with a dynamical exponent $z$ determined by $\alpha$. The black hole thermodynamics varies in an interesting way with $\alpha$, but in all cases the entropy is vanishing and the specific heat is positive for the near extremal solutions. We then compute conductivity in these backgrounds. We find that somewhat surprisingly, the AC conductivity vanishes like $\omega^2$ at T=0 independent of $\alpha$. We also explore the charged black brane physics of several other classes of gauge-coupling functions $f(\phi)$. In addition to possible applications in AdS/CMT, the extremal black branes are of interest from the point of view of the attractor mechanism.

The same metric exhibits a logarithmic violation of the area law of entanglement entropy, as shown recently by Ogawa et al. (arXiv:1111.1023). We study the dependence of the entanglement entropy on the shape of the entangling region(s), on the total charge density, on temperature, and on the presence of additional visible Fermi surfaces of gauge-neutral fermions; for the latter computations, we realize the needed metric in an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory.

As a consequence, a fruitful interplay has developed between analyses of strongly-coupled non-abelian plasmas via the gauge/string duality (also referred to as the AdS/CFT correspondence) and the phenomenology of heavy ion collisions. We review some of the main insights gained from this interplay to date. To establish a common language, we start with an introduction to heavy ion phenomenology and finite-temperature QCD, and a corresponding introduction to important concepts and techniques in the gauge/string duality. These introductory sections are written for nonspecialists, with the goal of bringing readers ranging from beginning graduate students to experienced practitioners of either QCD or gauge/string duality to the point that they understand enough about both fields that they can then appreciate their interplay in all appropriate contexts. We then review the current state-of-the art in the application of the duality to the description of the dynamics of strongly coupled plasmas, with emphases that include: its thermodynamic, hydrodynamic and transport properties/ the way it both modifies the dynamics of, and is perturbed by, high-energy or heavy quarks passing through it/ and the physics of quarkonium mesons within it. We seek throughout to stress the lessons that can be extracted from these computations for heavy ion physics as well as to discuss future directions and open problems for the field.","2014","2023-09-19 07:46:17","2024-02-18 13:42:32","2023-03-16","","","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","Cambridge","","","","INSPIRE","883144","","","809 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 749 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: Casalderrey-Solana:2011dxg arXiv:1101.0618 [hep-th] DOI: 10.1017/CBO9781139136747","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/IHHG43IS/Casalderrey-Solana2011dxg.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All the low-energy degrees of freedom induced by quantum criticality are usually assumed to be spatially extended, corresponding to long-wavelength fluctuations of the order parameter. But this picture has been contradicted by the results of recent experiments on a prototype system: heavy fermion metals at a zero-temperature magnetic transition. In particular, neutron scattering from CeCu6-x Aux has revealed anomalous dynamics at atomic length scales, leading to much debate as to the fate of the local moments in the quantum-critical regime. Here we report our theoretical finding of a locally critical quantum phase transition in a model of heavy fermions. The dynamics at the critical point are in agreement with experiment.

We numerically compute the electromagnetic and gravitational quasinormal frequencies (in the shear channel) of the extremal Reissner-Nordstrom AdS(4) black hole corresponding to the spectrum of poles in the retarded correlators. The picture that emerges is quite simple: there is a branch cut along the negative imaginary frequency axis, and a series of isolated poles corresponding to damped excitations.

These developments suggest that the physics of such matter may be governed by surprisingly simple principles. My real objective is to present an experimental strategy to test critically whether these principles are actually at work, revolving around the famous linear resistivity characterizing the strange metal phase. The theory suggests a very simple explanation of this ""unreasonably simple"" behavior that is actually directly linked to remarkable results from the study of the quark gluon plasma formed at the heavy ion colliders: the ""fast hydrodynamization"" and the ""minimal viscosity"". This leads to high quality predictions for experiment: the momentum relaxation rate governing the resistivity relates directly to the electronic entropy, while at low temperatures the electron fluid should become unviscous to a degree that turbulent flows can develop even on the nanometre scale.","2019-05-20","2022-10-27 08:38:24","2024-02-18 13:42:01","2023-08-09 07:39:23","061","","5","6","","SciPost Phys.","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1684344","DOI.org (Crossref)","","74 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 69 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: Zaanen:2018edk tex.ids= zaanenPlanckianDissipationMinimal2019 arXiv: 1807.10951 [cond-mat.str-el] tex.eprint: 1807.10951","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/QF8QRGDP/Zaanen2018edk.pdf","","Condensed Matter - Strongly Correlated Electrons; High Energy Physics - Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The basic electronic structure of cuprates is reviewed, emphasizing the physics of strong correlation and establishing the model of a doped Mott insulator as a starting point. A variety of experiments are discussed, focusing on the region of the phase diagram close to the Mott insulator (the underdoped region) where the behavior is most anomalous. The normal state in this region exhibits pseudogap phenomenon. In contrast, the quasiparticles in the superconducting state are well defined and behave according to theory. This review introduces Anderson’s idea of the resonating valence bond and argues that it gives a qualitative account of the data. The importance of phase fluctuations is discussed, leading to a theory of the transition temperature, which is driven by phase fluctuations and the thermal excitation of quasiparticles. However, an argument is made that phase fluctuations can only explain pseudogap phenomenology over a limited temperature range, and some additional physics is needed to explain the onset of singlet formation at very high temperatures. A description of the numerical method of the projected wave function is presented, which turns out to be a very useful technique for implementing the strong correlation constraint and leads to a number of predictions which are in agreement with experiments. The remainder of the paper deals with an analytic treatment of the t−J model, with the goal of putting the resonating valence bond idea on a more formal footing. The slave boson is introduced to enforce the constraint againt double occupation and it is shown that the implementation of this local constraint leads naturally to gauge theories. This review follows the historical order by first examining the U(1) formulation of the gauge theory. Some inadequacies of this formulation for underdoping are discussed, leading to the SU(2) formulation. Here follows a rather thorough discussion of the role of gauge theory in describing the spin-liquid phase of the undoped Mott insulator. The difference between the high-energy gauge group in the formulation of the problem versus the low-energy gauge group, which is an emergent phenomenon, is emphasized. Several possible routes to deconfinement based on different emergent gauge groups are discussed, which leads to the physics of fractionalization and spin-charge separation. Next the extension of the SU(2) formulation to nonzero doping is described with a focus on a part of the mean-field phase diagram called the staggered flux liquid phase. It will be shown that inclusion of the gauge fluctuation provides a reasonable description of the pseudogap phase. It is emphasized that d-wave superconductivity can be considered as evolving from a stable U(1) spin liquid. These ideas are applied to the high-Tc cuprates, and their implications for the vortex structure and the phase diagram are discussed. A possible test of the topological structure of the pseudogap phase is described.","2006-01-06","2022-10-27 08:39:21","2024-02-18 13:42:53","2022-10-27 08:39:19","17-85","","1","78","","Rev. Mod.

Here we show that T-linear resistivity as T → 0 is a generic property of cuprates, associated with a universal scattering rate. We measured the low-temperature resistivity of the bilayer cuprate Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+δ and found that it exhibits a T-linear dependence with the same slope as in the single-layer cuprates Bi2Sr2CuO6+δ (ref. 6), La1.6-xNd0.4SrxCuO4 (ref. 7) and La2-xSrxCuO4 (ref. 8), despite their very different Fermi surfaces and structural, superconducting and magnetic properties. We then show that the T-linear coefficient (per CuO2 plane), A1□, is given by the universal relation A1□TF = h/2e2, where e is the electron charge, h is the Planck constant and TF is the Fermi temperature. This relation, obtained by assuming that the scattering rate 1/τ of charge carriers reaches the Planckian limit9,10, whereby ħ/τ = kBT, works not only for hole-doped cuprates6–8,11,12 but also for electron-doped cuprates13,14, despite the different nature of their quantum critical point and strength of their electron correlations.","2019-02","2022-10-27 08:35:51","2024-02-18 13:42:05","","142–147","","2","15","","","","","","","","","","english","","","","","","","74 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 73 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: legrosUniversalTlinearResistivity2019 tex.ids= legros2019 tex.copyright: 2018 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited tex.eprint: 1805.02512 publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/EMVXSV8W/legros2019.pdf","","Electronic properties and materials; Superconducting properties and materials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The properties of the quantum nonlinear σ model are analyzed approximately using the one-loop renormalization-group method. When the model has long-range order at T=0, the long-wavelength behavior at finite temperatures can be described by a purely classical model, with parameters renormalized by the quantum fluctuations. The low-temperature behavior of the correlation length and the static and dynamic staggered-spin-correlation functions for the quantum antiferromagnet can be predicted, in principle, with no adjustable parameters, from the results of simulations of the classical model on a lattice, combined with a two-loop renormalization-group analysis of the classical nonlinear σ model, a calculation of the zero-temperature spin-wave stiffness constant and uniform susceptibility of the quantum antiferromagnet, and a one-loop analysis of the conversion from a lattice cutoff to the wave-vector cutoff introduced by quantum mechanics when the spin-wave frequency exceeds Tℏ. Applying this approach to the spin-½ Heisenberg model on a square lattice, with nearest-neighbor interactions only, we obtain a result for the correlation length which is in good agreement with the data of Endoh et al. on La2CuO4, if the spin-wave velocity is assumed to be 0.67 eV Åℏ. We also argue that the data on La2CuO4 cannot be easily explained by any model in which an isolated CuO2 layer would not have long-range antiferromagnetic order at T=0. Our theory also predicts a quasielastic peak of a few meV width at 300 K when kξ≪1 (where k is wave-vector transfer and ξ is the correlation length). The extent to which this dynamical prediction agrees with experiments remains to be seen. In an appendix, we discuss the effect of introducing a frustrating second-nearest-neighbor coupling for the antiferromagnet on the square lattice.","1989-02-01","2022-10-27 08:37:48","2024-02-18 13:43:09","2022-10-27 08:37:48","2344-2371","","4","39","","Phys.

The most dramatic spatial anisotropy at a critical point occurs at a Lifshitz transition, found in systems with merging Dirac or Weyl point or near the superconductor-insulator quantum phase transition. Previous work found that in these systems a famous conjecture on the existence of a lower bound for the ratio of a shear viscosity to entropy is violated, and proposed a generalization of this bound for anisotropic systems near charge neutrality involving the electric conductivities. The present study uses scaling arguments and the gauge-gravity duality to confirm the previous analysis of universal bounds in anisotropic Dirac systems. We investigate the strongly-coupled phase of quantum Lifshitz systems in a gravitational Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model with a linear massless scalar which breaks translations in the boundary dual field theory and sources the anisotropy. The holographic computation demonstrates that some elements of the viscosity tensor can be related to the ratio of the electric conductivities through a simple geometric ratio of elements of the bulk metric evaluated at the horizon, and thus obey a generalized bound, while others violate it. From the IR critical geometry, we express the charge diffusion constants in terms of the square butterfly velocities.

For transport, we target our analysis at finite chemical potential and include axion fields to generate momentum dissipation. While our exact results corroborate anticipated bounds, we are able to demonstrate that the diffusivities are governed by the engineering dimension of the diffusion coefficient, $[D]=2-z$. Consequently, a $\beta$-function defined as the derivative of the trace of the diffusion matrix with respect to the effective lattice spacing changes sign precisely at $z=2$. At $z=2$, the diffusion equation exhibits perfect scale invariance and the corresponding diffusion constant is the pure number $1/d_s$ for both the charge and energy sectors, where $d_s$ is the number of spatial dimensions.

Similar to the materials which exhibit thermal diffusivity close to this bound, our scenario involves complex unit cell with incoherent intra-cell dynamics. We derive a general formalism to compute thermal conductivity in such cases with anharmonic intra-cell dynamics coupled to nearly harmonic inter-cell coupling. Through direct numerical simulation of the non-linear unit cell motion, we explicitly show that our model allows sub-Planckian thermal diffusivity. We find that the propagator of the acoustic phonons becomes incoherent throughout most of the Brillouin zone in this limit.

Recently, a striking similarity between the SYK model and the Hund-coupling induced spin-freezing crossover in multi-orbital Hubbard models has been pointed out. To further explore this connection, we study OTOCs for fermionic Hubbard models, which are prototypical models for strongly correlated electrons in solids. We introduce an imaginary-time four-point correlation function with an appropriate time ordering, which by means of the spectral representation and the out-of-time-order fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be analytically continued to real-time OTOCs. Based on this approach, we numerically evaluate real-time OTOCs for Hubbard models in the thermodynamic limit, using the dynamical mean-field theory in combination with a numerically exact continuous-time Monte Carlo impurity solver. The results for the single-orbital model show that a certain spin-related OTOC captures local moment formation in the vicinity of the metal-insulator transition, while the self-energy does not show SYK-like non-Fermi liquid behavior. On the other hand, for the two- and three-orbital models with nonzero Hund coupling we find that the OTOC exhibits a rapid damping at short times and an approximate power-law decay at longer times in the spin-freezing crossover regime characterized by fluctuating local moments and a non-Fermi liquid self-energy $\Sigma(\omega) \sim \sqrt{\omega}$. These results are in a good agreement with the behavior of the SYK model, providing firm evidence for the close relation between the spin-freezing crossover physics of multi-orbital Hubbard models and the SYK strange metal.","2019-03-22","2023-09-12 13:05:02","2023-09-12 13:05:44","","115132","","11","99","","Phys.

In particular, we focus on Q-lattices and the Bianchy VII helix. We show that the hydrodynamic sound mode is removed from the spectrum due to the strong momentum relaxation and therefore, the usual treatment of the plasmon as Coulomb-dressed zero sound does not apply. Furthermore, the dominant coherent modes in the longitudinal channel, which control the neutral density-density correlator, are diffusive. We show these modes are strongly suppressed when the boundary Coulomb interaction is turned on. This renders the low frequency charge density response spectrum completely incoherent and featureless. At intermediate frequencies, we observe a broad feature -- the fake plasmon -- in the dressed correlator, which could be confused with an overdamped plasmon. However, its gap is set by the scale of translation symmetry breaking instead of the plasma frequency. This broad feature originates from the non-hydrodynamic sector of the holographic spectrum, and therefore, its behaviour, typical of strongly correlated quantum critical systems with holographic duals, deviates from the standard Fermi-liquid paradigm.","2019-12-30","2023-09-12 13:05:02","2023-09-12 13:05:44","","159","","","12","","JHEP","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1756199","","","6 citations (INSPIRE 2023/9/12) 6 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2023/9/12) Citation Key: Andrade:2019bky arXiv:1909.12242 [hep-th]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/ERXNRM6T/Andrade2019bky.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to rapid progress in growing exceptionally pure crystals, we are now able to experimentally observe this collective motion of electrons in solid-state systems, including graphene. We present a review of recent progress in understanding the hydrodynamic limit of electronic motion in graphene, written for physicists from diverse communities. We begin by discussing the ""phase diagram"" of graphene, and the inevitable presence of impurities and phonons in experimental systems. We derive hydrodynamics, both from a phenomenological perspective and using kinetic theory. We then describe how hydrodynamic electron flow is visible in electronic transport measurements. Although we focus on graphene in this review, the broader framework naturally generalizes to other materials. We assume only basic knowledge of condensed matter physics, and no prior knowledge of hydrodynamics.","2018-01-05","2022-05-27 09:11:26","2024-02-18 13:42:12","2022-05-27 09:11:26","053001","","5","30","","J.

Using this method, we compute the numerical spectrum of quasinormal modes associated with fluctuations of spin 0, 1 and 2, non-perturbatively in $\mu/T$. We also analytically compute the spectrum of hydrodynamic excitations in the small chemical potential limit. Then, by studying the spectral curve at complex momenta in every spin channel, we numerically find points at which hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic poles collide. We discuss the relation between such collision points and the convergence radius of the hydrodynamic derivative expansion. Specifically in the spin 0 channel, we find that within the range $1.1\lesssim \mu/T\lesssim 2$, the radius of convergence of the hydrodynamic sound mode is set by the absolute value of the complex momentum corresponding to the point at which the sound pole collides with the hydrodynamic diffusion pole. It shows that in holographic systems at finite chemical potential, the convergence of the hydrodynamic derivative expansion in the mentioned range is fully controlled by hydrodynamic information. As the last result, we explicitly show that the relevant information about quantum chaos in our system can be extracted from the pole-skipping points of energy density response function. We find a threshold value for $\mu/T$, lower than which the pole-skipping points can be computed perturbatively in a derivative expansion.","2020-10-13","2021-12-01 09:56:40","2024-02-18 13:41:44","2021-12-01 09:56:40","076","","10","10","","JHEP","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1807892","arXiv.org","","57 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 53 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: Abbasi:2020ykq tex.ids= Abbasi:2020ykqa arXiv: 2007.10024 [hep-th]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/KREF2RIG/Abbasi2020ykq.pdf","","High Energy Physics - Theory; Nuclear Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The thermodynamics of AdS black holes in Einstein-scalar gravity is studied by using the standard holographic renormalization procedure and the variation of the Hamiltonian via the Wald formalism. It is found that the first law requires a modification by including an additional term that has a particular form $\sim\left<O\right>\delta \phi_s$, with $\phi_s$ and $\left<O\right>$ a new pair of thermodynamic conjugate variables. $\phi_s$ is the leading source term of the asymptotic fall-off of the scalar field near the AdS boundary, and $\left<O\right>$ is precisely the response of the dual scalar operator from the holographic point of view.

In the vicinity of a quantum critical point, it is expected that some aspects of the dynamics are universal and dictated by properties of the critical point. We use gauge-gravity duality to investigate the breakdown of diffusive hydrodynamics in two low temperature states dual to black holes with AdS$_2$ horizons, which exhibit quantum critical dynamics with an emergent scaling symmetry in time. We find that the breakdown is characterized by a collision between the diffusive pole of the retarded Green's function with a pole associated to the AdS$_2$ region of the geometry, such that the local equilibration time is set by infra-red properties of the theory. The absolute values of the frequency and wavevector at the collision ($\omega_{eq}$ and $k_{eq}$) provide a natural characterization of all the low temperature diffusivities $D$ of the states via $D=\omega_{eq}/k_{eq}^2$ where $\omega_{eq}=2\pi\Delta T$ is set by the temperature $T$ and the scaling dimension $\Delta$ of an operator of the infra-red quantum critical theory. We confirm that these relations are also satisfied in an SYK chain model in the limit of strong interactions.

The CFT operators of interest are the ""OPE blocks,"" contributions to the OPE from a single conformal family. In holographic theories, we show that the OPE blocks are dual at leading order in 1/N to integrals of effective bulk fields along geodesics or homogeneous minimal surfaces in anti-de Sitter space. One widely studied example of an OPE block is the modular Hamiltonian, which is dual to the fluctuation in the area of a minimal surface. Thus, our operators pave the way for generalizing the Ryu-Takayanagi relation to other bulk fields. Although the OPE blocks are non-local operators in the CFT, they admit a simple geometric description as fields in kinematic space--the space of pairs of CFT points. We develop the tools for constructing local bulk operators in terms of these non-local objects.

However, recent advances in quantum information theory have highlighted the role of its symmetric counterpart, the quantum metric tensor. In this paper, we perform a detailed analysis of the ground state Riemannian geometry induced by the metric tensor, using the quantum XY chain in a transverse field as our primary example. We focus on a particular geometric invariant -- the Gaussian curvature -- and show how both integrals of the curvature within a given phase and singularities of the curvature near phase transitions are protected by critical scaling theory. For cases where the curvature is integrable, we show that the integrated curvature provides a new geometric invariant, which like the Chern number characterizes individual phases of matter. For cases where the curvature is singular, we classify three types -- integrable, conical, and curvature singularities -- and detail situations where each type of singularity should arise. Finally, to connect this abstract geometry to experiment, we discuss three different methods for measuring the metric tensor, namely via integrating a properly weighted noise spectral function and by using leading order responses of the work distribution to ramps and quenches in quantum many-body systems.","2013-08-19","2020-12-15 09:24:53","2024-02-18 13:42:32","2020-12-15 09:24:53","064304","","6","88","","Phys.

For TFD states at t > 0, we demonstrate that the complexity evolves in time and saturates after a time of the order of the inverse temperature. The latter feature, which is in contrast with the results of holographic proposals, is due to the Gaussian nature of the TFD state of the free bosonic QFT. A novel technical aspect of our work is framing complexity calculations in the language of covariance matrices and the associated symplectic transformations, which provide a natural language for dealing with Gaussian states. Furthermore, for free QFTs in 1+1 dimension, we compare the dynamics of circuit complexity with the time dependence of the entanglement entropy for simple bipartitions of TFDs.

Explicit formulae are given for representations of Virasoro and affine algebras in terms of a local gauge choice on the line bundle associated with geometric quantization of a given coadjoint orbit; these formulae define a new set of explicit bosonic realizations of these algebras. The coadjoint orbit realizations take the form of dual Verma modules, making it possible to avoid the technical difficulties associated with the two-sided resolutions which arise from Feigin-Fuchs and Wakimoto realizations. Formulae are given for screening and intertwining operators on the coadjoint orbit representations. Chiral vertex operators between Virasoro modules are constructed, and related directly to Virasoro algebra generators in certain cases. From the point of view taken in this thesis, vertex operators have a geometric interpretation as differential operators taking sections of one line bundle to sections of another.

Inhomogeneous cost functions ---many examples of which have been recently proposed in the literature--- are ruled out by our analysis. Such measures are shown to be unrelated to circuit complexity in general and to produce severe violations of Lloyd's bound in simple situations. Among the metrics which do provide lower bounds, the idea is to select those which produce the tightest possible ones. This establishes a hierarchy of cost functions and considerably reduces the list of candidate complexity measures. In particular, the criterion suggests a canonical way of dealing with penalties, consisting in assigning infinite costs to directions not belonging to the gate set. We discuss how this can be implemented through the use of Lagrange multipliers. We argue that one of the surviving cost functions defines a particularly canonical notion in the sense that: i) it straightforwardly follows from the standard Hermitian metric in Hilbert space; ii) its associated complexity functional is closely related to Kirillov's coadjoint orbit action, providing an explicit realization of the ``complexity equals action'' idea; iii) it arises from a Hamilton-Jacobi analysis of the ``quantum action'' describing quantum dynamics in the phase space canonically associated to every Hilbert space.

Previously, it was shown that by choosing a suitable cost function, the resulting complexity functional is equivalent to geometric (group) actions on coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro group, up to a term that originates from the central extension. We show that this term can be recovered by modifying the cost function, making the equivalence exact. Moreover, we generalize our approach to Kac-Moody symmetry groups, finding again an exact equivalence between complexity functionals and geometric actions. We then determine the optimal circuits for these complexity measures and calculate the corresponding costs for several examples of optimal transformations. In the Virasoro case, we find that for all choices of reference state except for the vacuum state, the complexity only measures the cost associated to phase changes, while assigning zero cost to the non-phase changing part of the transformation. For Kac-Moody groups in contrast, there do exist non-trivial optimal transformations beyond phase changes that contribute to the complexity, yielding a finite gauge invariant result. Furthermore, we also show that the alternative complexity proposal of path integral optimization is equivalent to the Virasoro proposal studied here. Finally, we sketch a new proposal for a complexity definition for the Virasoro group that measures the cost associated to non-trivial transformations beyond phase changes. This proposal is based on a cost function given by a metric on the Lie group of conformal transformations. The minimization of the corresponding complexity functional is achieved using the Euler-Arnold method yielding the Korteweg-de Vries equation as equation of motion.","2020-11-04","2023-09-12 13:24:15","2024-02-18 13:41:43","","003","","","11","","JHEP","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1790458","","","71 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 63 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: Erdmenger:2020sup arXiv:2004.03619 [hep-th]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/V7FGDFP2/Erdmenger2020sup.pdf","","To Read","High Energy Physics - Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vidal, arXiv:1807.02501], that MERA on the real line (and finite circle) can be given a rigorous interpretation as a two-dimensional geometry, namely a light sheet (respectively, a light cone). Accordingly, MERA describes neither the hyperbolic plane nor de Sitter spacetime. However, we also propose euclidean and lorentzian generalizations of MERA that correspond to a path integral on these two geometries.","2018-12","2023-09-12 13:24:13","2024-02-18 13:42:06","","","","","","","arXiv:1812.00529 [hep-th]","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1706223","","","72 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 67 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: Milsted:2018san arXiv:1812.00529 [hep-th]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/QG5H3DLG/Milsted2018san.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This 2d-dimensional space naturally captures some of the fundamental nonlocality and causal structure inherent in the entanglement of CFT states. For any primary CFT operator, we construct an observable on this space, which is defined by smearing the associated one-point function over causal diamonds. Known examples of such quantities are the entanglement entropy of vacuum excitations and its higher spin generalizations. We show that in holographic CFTs, these observables are given by suitably defined integrals of dual bulk fields over the corresponding Ryu-Takayanagi minimal surfaces. Furthermore, we explain connections to the operator product expansion and the first law of entanglement entropy from this unifying point of view. We demonstrate that for small perturbations of the vacuum, our observables obey linear two-derivative equations of motion on the space of causal diamonds. In two dimensions, the latter is given by a product of two copies of a two-dimensional de Sitter space. For a class of universal states, we show that the entanglement entropy and its spin-three generalization obey nonlinear equations of motion with local interactions on this moduli space, which can be identified with Liouville and Toda equations, respectively. This suggests the possibility of extending the definition of our new observables beyond the linear level more generally and in such a way that they give rise to new dynamically interacting theories on the moduli space of causal diamonds.

The orbit method extends the kinematic space dictionary, which was originally motivated through connections to integral geometry, by directly translating geometrical properties of holographic auxiliary spaces into statements about the representation theory of the conformal group.","2019-07-09","2020-02-07 11:25:03","2024-02-18 13:42:00","2020-02-07 11:25:03","045","","7","07","","JHEP","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1707495","arXiv.org","","13 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 10 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: Penna:2018xqq arXiv:1812.02176 [hep-th]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/CYWI489L/Penna2018xqq.pdf","","","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology; High Energy Physics - Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this letter, we bridge the gap between these two proposals in two-dimensional conformal field theories, by explicitly showing how the latter approach from path integral optimization may be given a concrete realization within the standard gate counting framework.

On the other hand, it is known that there exists a precise relation between geometric actions and Berry phases defined in group representations. Motivated by these connections, we elaborate on a relation between circuit complexity and the group theoretic Berry phase. As the simplest setup relevant for holography, we discuss the case of two dimensional conformal field theories. In the large central charge limit, we identify the computational cost function with the Berry connection in the unitary representation of the Virasoro group. We then use the latter identification to express the Berry phase in terms of the Virasoro circuit complexity. The former can be seen as the holonomy of the Berry connection along the path in the group manifold which defines the protocol. In addition, we derive a proportionality relation between Virasoro circuit complexity and the logarithm of the inner product between a particularly chosen reference state and the prepared target state. In this sense, the logarithmic formula turns out to be approximating the complexity up to some additive constant if the building blocks of the circuit are taken to be the underlying symmetry gates. Predictions based on this formula have recently been shown to coincide with the holographic complexity proposals and the path integral optimization procedure. The found connections may therefore help to better understand such coincidences. We also discuss that our findings, put together with earlier observations, may suggest a connection between the Virasoro Berry phase and the complexity measure in the path integral optimization proposal.","2022-01-11","2023-09-12 13:24:15","2023-09-19 08:19:26","","025012","","2","105","","Phys.

A general method for finding classical limits in arbitrary quantum theories is developed. The method is based on certain assumptions which isolate the minimal structure any quantum theory should possess if it is to have a classical limit. In any theory satisfying these assumptions, one can generate a natural set of generalized coherent states. These coherent states may then be used to construct a classical phase space, derive a classical Hamiltonian, and show that the resulting classical dynamics is equivalent to the limiting form of the original quantum dynamics. This formalism is shown to be applicable to the large N limits of vector models, matrix models, and gauge theories. In every case, one can explicitly derive a classical action which contains the complete physics of the N=∞ theory. ""Solving"" the N=∞ theory requires minimizing the classical Hamiltonian, and this has been possible only in simple theories. The relation between this approach and other methods which have been proposed for deriving large N limits is discussed in detail.","1982","2020-02-07 13:27:39","2024-02-18 13:43:13","2020-02-07 13:27:39","407","","2","54","","Rev.

In this paper, the classification of orbits is reconsidered, with an explicit description of the possible centralizers of coadjoint orbits. The possible orbits are diff(S1) itself, diff(S1)/S1, and diff(S1)/SL(n)(2,R), withSL(n)(2,R) a certain discrete series of embeddings ofSL(2,R) in diff(S1), and diffS1/T, whereT may be any of certain rather special one parameter subgroups of diffS1. An attempt is made to clarify the relation between orbits and representations. It appears that quantization of diffS1/S1 is related to unitary representations with nondegenerate Kac determinant (unitary Verma modules), while quantization of diffS1/SL(n)(2,R) is seemingly related to unitary representations with null vectors in leveln. A better understanding of how to quantize the relevant orbits might lead to a better geometrical understanding of Virasoro representation theory. In the process of investigating Virasoro coadjoint orbits, we observe the existence of left invariant symplectic structures on the Virasoro group manifold. As is described in an appendix, these give rise to Lie bialgebra structures with the Virasoro algebra as the underlying Lie algebra.","1988","2020-02-07 11:38:46","2024-02-18 13:43:09","2020-02-07 11:38:46","1","","1","114","","Commun.

The result is that, for a given dynamical group, the coherent states are isomorphic to a coset space of group geometrical space. Thus the topological and algebraic structure of the coherent states as well as the associated dynamical system can be extensively discussed. In addition, a quantum-mechanical phase-space representation is constructed via the coherent-state theory. Several useful methods for employing the coherent states to study the physical phenomena of quantum-dynamic systems, such as the path integral, variational principle, classical limit, and thermodynamic limit of quantum mechanics, are described.","1990","2021-01-25 09:57:17","2024-02-18 13:43:07","2021-01-25 09:57:17","867-927","","4","62","","Rev.

We center our discussion around adiabatic gauge potentials, which are the generators of unitary basis transformations in quantum systems and generators of special canonical transformations in classical systems. In quantum systems, eigenstate expectation values of these potentials are the Berry connections and the covariance matrix of these gauge potentials is the geometric tensor, whose antisymmetric part defines the Berry curvature and whose symmetric part is the Fubini-Study metric tensor. In classical systems one simply replaces the eigenstate expectation value by an average over the micro-canonical shell. For complicated interacting systems, we show that a variational principle may be used to derive approximate gauge potentials. We then express the non-adiabatic response of the physical observables of the system through these gauge potentials, specifically demonstrating the close connection of the geometric tensor to the notions of Lorentz force and renormalized mass. We highlight applications of this formalism to deriving counter-diabatic (dissipationless) driving protocols in various systems, as well as to finding equations of motion for slow macroscopic parameters coupled to fast microscopic degrees of freedom that go beyond macroscopic Hamiltonian dynamics. Finally, we illustrate these ideas with a number of simple examples and highlight a few more complicated ones drawn from recent literature.","2017-06","2020-12-15 09:29:24","2024-02-18 13:42:17","2020-12-15 09:29:24","1-87","","","697","","Physics Reports","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","143 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 128 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) tex.ids= Kolodrubetz2017, kolodrubetz2017a arXiv: 1602.01062 publisher: Elsevier BV","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/UMMJQ3E2/kolodrubetz2017.pdf; /home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/RMDUDJ2Q/kolodrubetz2017.pdf","","","Condensed Matter - Quantum Gases; Condensed Matter - Statistical Mechanics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose an innovative method to extract informations about CFT's in a quantitative way. Studying the crossing symmetry of the four point function of scalar operators we derive consistency constraints on the CFT structure, in the form of functional sum rules. The technique we introduce allows to address the feasibility of the sum rule and translate it into restrictions on the CFT spectrum and interactions. Our analysis only assumes unitarity of the CFT, crossing symmetry of the four point function and existence of an Operator Product Expansion (OPE) for scalars. We demonstrate that a CFT satisfying the above hypothesis and containing a scalar operator is not compatible with arbitrary spectra of the operators nor with arbitrary large OPE coefficients. More specifically we prove two main results. First, the spectrum of the CFT must contain a second scalar operator with dimension smaller than a given value. Second, the value of the three point function of two scalars with equal dimension and a third arbitrary operator is bounded from above. As an application of the fist statement we present the bound on the smallest dimension operator entering the OPE of a real scalar with itself. We perform the analysis in two and four dimensions. The comparison of the two dimensional case with exactly solvable models shows a saturation of the bound. We repeat for CFT's with global symmetries and superconformal field theories in four dimensions. As a demonstration of the second result we provide a lower bound on the central charge for CFT in two and four dimensions without global symmetries and for superconformal field theories. We also discuss in the potentialities of the method and possible future research lines. Finally, we discuss possible implications for model building beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.","2011","2020-10-27 08:29:29","2023-09-19 08:16:11","2020-10-27 08:29:29","","","","","","","","","","","","École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne","","en","","PhD Thesis","","","","","ZSCC: 0000016 tex.ids= Vichi2011, Vichi:2011zza DOI: 10.5075/epfl-thesis-5116 number: THESIS publisher: EPFL","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/QDV3YEC3/vichi2011.pdf","","","⛔ No INSPIRE recid found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The statement of the Luttinger theorem, the equality between the fermion charge density and the volume enclosed by the Fermi surface, can be mapped to a Gauss's law in the gravity dual, a la Sachdev. We show that various deformations in the gravity dual, such as inclusion of magnetic fields, a parity-violating theta-term, dilatonic deformations, and higher-derivative corrections, do not violate the holographic derivation of the Luttinger theorem, as long as the theory is in a confining phase.

On the other hand, in the deconfined phase, we also show that the deficit appearing in the Luttinger theorem is again universal.

The magnitude of S/T in the T=0 limit is found to suddenly increase, by a factor ≃5, when the doping is reduced below p★=0.23, the critical doping for the onset of the pseudogap phase. This confirms that the pseudogap phase causes a large reduction of the carrier density n, consistent with a drop from n=1+p above p★ to n=p below p★, as previously inferred from measurements of the Hall coefficient, resistivity, and thermal conductivity. When the doping is reduced below p=0.19, a qualitative change is observed whereby S/T decreases as T→0, eventually to reach negative values at T=0. In prior work on other cuprates, negative values of S/T at T→0 were shown to result from a reconstruction of the Fermi surface caused by charge density wave (CDW) order. We therefore identify pCDW≃0.19 as the critical doping beyond which there is no CDW-induced Fermi surface reconstruction. The fact that pCDW is well separated from p★ reveals that there is a doping range below p★ where the transport signatures of the pseudogap phase are unaffected by CDW correlations, as previously found in YBa2Cu3Oy and La2−xSrxCuO4.","2021-04-01","2022-10-27 09:00:23","2024-02-18 13:41:37","2023-09-12 14:01:06","155102","","15","103","","Phys.

Here, we review a class of materials, known as \lq strange' metals, that can violate both principles. In materials exhibiting such behavior, the change in slope of the resistivity as the mean free path drops below the lattice constant, or as $T \rightarrow 0$, can be imperceptible, suggesting complete continuity between the charge carriers at low and high $T$. Since particles cannot scatter at length scales shorter than the interatomic spacing, strange metallicity calls into question the relevance of locality and a particle picture of the underlying current. This review focuses on transport and spectroscopic data on candidate strange metals with an eye to isolate and identify a unifying physical principle. Special attention is paid to quantum criticality, Planckian dissipation, Mottness, and whether a new gauge principle, which has a clear experimental signature, is needed to account for the non-local transport seen in strange metals. For the cuprates, strange metallicity is shown to track the superfluid density, thereby making a theory of this state the primary hurdle in solving the riddle of high-temperature superconductivity.","2022-07-08","2022-10-27 08:33:00","2024-02-18 13:41:16","2022-10-27 08:32:59","abh4273","","6602","377","","Science","","","","","","","","en","","","INSPIRE","2087958","DOI.org (Crossref)","","14 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 13 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: Phillips:2022nxs tex.ids= phillipsStrangerMetals2022 arXiv:2205.12979 [cond-mat.str-el] tex.eprint: 2205.12979 publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/8NR7S7B6/Phillips2022nxs.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We do this by studying the simplest finite density system arising from the duality, obtained by turning on a nonzero chemical potential for a U(1) global symmetry of a CFT, and described on the gravity side by a charged black hole. We address the following questions of such a finite density system: 1. Does the system have a Fermi surface? What are the properties of low energy excitations near the Fermi surface? 2. Does the system have an instability to condensation of scalar operators? What is the critical behavior near the corresponding quantum critical point? We find interesting parallels with those of high T_c cuprates and heavy electron systems. Playing a crucial role in our discussion is a universal intermediate-energy phase, called a ""semi-local quantum liquid"", which underlies the non-Fermi liquid and novel quantum critical behavior of a system.

At nonzero temperature, the effects of dissipation can be captured by hydrodynamics at sufficiently long scales compared to the local equilibrium. Here we show that in the limit of weak explicit breaking, locality of hydrodynamics implies that the damping of pseudo-Goldstones is completely determined by their mass and diffusive transport coefficients. We present many applications: superfluids, QCD in the chiral limit, Wigner crystal and density wave phases in the presence of an external magnetic field or not, nematic phases and (anti-)ferromagnets. For electronic density wave phases, pseudo-Goldstone damping generates a contribution to the resistivity independent of the strength of disorder, which can have a linear temperature dependence provided the associated diffusivity saturates a bound.

This includes momentum relaxation times previously derived by the memory matrix formalism, and non-perturbative holographic results; in the latter case, this is subject to some important subtleties.

The identification of a universal velocity scale, independent of the presence of well-defined quasiparticle excitations, is one of the major challenges of this program. A recent analysis, valid for emergent IR fixed points exhibiting local quantum criticality, and dual to IR AdS$_2$ geometries, suggests to identify such a velocity using the time and length scales at which hydrodynamics breaks down -- the equilibration velocity. The latter relates to the radius of convergence of the hydrodynamic expansion and it is extracted from a collision between a hydrodynamic diffusive mode and a non-hydrodynamic mode associated to the IR AdS$_2$ region. In this short note, we confirm this picture for holographic systems displaying the spontaneous breaking of translational invariance. Moreover, we find that, at zero temperature, the lower bound set by quantum chaos and the upper one defined by causality and hydrodynamics exactly coincide, determining uniquely the diffusion constant.

The information recovered from the shock wave can be reconstructed in terms of purely diffusion-like, linearized gravitational waves at the horizon of a single-sided black hole with specific regularity-enforced imaginary values of frequency and momentum. In two-derivative bulk theories, this horizon ""diffusion"" can be related to late-time momentum diffusion via a simple relation, which ceases to hold in higher-derivative theories. We then show that the same values of imaginary frequency and momentum follow from a dispersion relation of a hydrodynamic sound mode. The frequency, momentum and group velocity give the holographic Lyapunov exponent and the butterfly velocity. Moreover, at this special point along the sound dispersion relation curve, the residue of the retarded longitudinal stress-energy tensor two-point function vanishes. This establishes a direct link between a hydrodynamic sound mode at an analytically continued, imaginary momentum and the holographic butterfly effect.

Axion-dilaton model is particularly interesting since it shows linear-$T$-resistivity, which may have something to do with the universal bound of diffusion. At finite density, there are two diffusion constants $D_\pm$ describing the coupled diffusion of charge and energy. By computing $D_\pm$ exactly, we find that in the incoherent regime ($\beta/T \gg 1,\ \beta/\mu \gg 1$) $D_+$ is identified with the charge diffusion constant ($D_c$) and $D_-$ is identified with the energy diffusion constant ($D_e$). In the coherent regime, at very small density, $D_\pm$ are `maximally' mixed in the sense that $D_+(D_-)$ is identified with $D_e(D_c)$, which is opposite to the case in the incoherent regime. In the incoherent regime $D_e \sim C_- \hbar v_B^2 / k_B T$ where $C_- = 1/2$ or 1 so it is universal independently of $\beta$ and $\mu$. However, $D_c \sim C_+ \hbar v_B^2 / k_B T$ where $C_+ = 1$ or $ \beta^2/16\pi^2 T^2$ so, in general, $C_+$ may not saturate to the lower bound in the incoherent regime, which suggests that the characteristic velocity for charge diffusion may not be the butterfly velocity.

In the case of doubletrace deformations, and for bulk scalars with masses in the range $-d^2/4<m^2<-d^2/4+1$, the deformed theory flows between two fixed points of the renormalization group, manifesting a resonant behavior at the scale characterizing the transition between the two CFT's.

At the same time, the optical conductivity ceases to be of Drude form at high temperatures, suggesting a change of the underlying dynamics that surprisingly leaves the $T$-linear DC-resistivity unaffected. We use the AdS/CFT correspondence that describes strongly coupled, densely entangled metals to study DC thermo-electrical transport and the optical conductivities of the local quantum critical Gubser-Rocha holographic strange metal in the presence of a lattice potential, a prime candidate to compare with experiment. We find that the DC-resistivity is linear in $T$ at low temperatures for a range of lattice strengths and wavevectors, even as it transitions between different dissipative regimes. At weak lattice potential the optical conductivity evolves with increasing temperature from a Drude form to a bad-metal characterized by a mid-IR resonance without changing the DC transport, similar to that seen in cuprate strange metals. This mid-IR peak and its temperature evolution can be understood as a consequence of Umklapp hydrodynamics: hydrodynamic perturbations are Bloch modes in the presence of a lattice. At strong lattice potential an incoherent metal is realized instead where momentum conservation no longer plays a role in transport. In this regime the thermal diffusivity can be explained by Planckian dissipation originating in universal microscopic chaos, similar to holographic metals with strong homogeneous momentum relaxation. The charge diffusivity does not submit to this chaos explanation, even though the continuing linear-in-$T$ DC resistivity saturates to an apparent universal slope, numerically equal to a Planckian rate.","2023-09-15","2022-12-09 16:25:04","2023-09-29 08:20:27","2022-12-09 16:25:04","125145","","12","108","","Phys.

It is dual to a local quantum critical phase instead of a quantum critical point. This result follows from a detailed analysis of the possible quantizations of the gravitational theory that is consistent with the thermodynamics of the analytical Gubser-Rocha black hole solution. The analytic Gubser-Rocha black hole is only a 2-parameter subset of all possible solutions, and we construct other members numerically. These new numerical solutions correspond to turning on an additional scalar charge. Moreover, each solution has multiple holographic interpretations depending on the quantization chosen. In one particular quantization involving a multitrace deformation the scalar charge is a marginal operator. In other quantizations where the marginal multitrace operator is turned off, the analytic Gubser-Rocha black hole does not describe a finite temperature conformal fluid.","2023-03-13","2023-03-15 09:43:05","2023-09-29 08:20:24","2023-03-15 09:43:05","081","","3","03","","JHEP","","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","INSPIRE","2157967","Springer Link","","2 citations (INSPIRE 2023/8/4) 0 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2023/8/4) Citation Key: Chagnet:2022yhs arXiv:2209.13951 [hep-th] publisher: arXiv versionNumber: 4","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/YST9H9D5/Chagnet2022yhs.pdf","","""myPubs""; High Energy Physics - Theory","AdS-CFT Correspondence; FOS: Physical sciences; Gauge-Gravity Correspondence; High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Holography and Condensed Matter Physics (AdS/CMT); Renormalization Group","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An important question is to understand what is special about maximally chaotic systems which saturate this bound. Here we provide further evidence for the `hydrodynamic' origin of chaos in such systems, and discuss hallmarks of maximally chaotic systems. We first provide evidence that a hydrodynamic effective field theory of chaos we previously proposed should be understood as a theory of maximally chaotic systems. We then emphasize and make explicit a signature of maximal chaos which was only implicit in prior literature, namely the suppression of exponential growth in commutator squares of generic few-body operators. We provide a general argument for this suppression within our chaos effective field theory, and illustrate it using SYK models and holographic systems. We speculate that this suppression indicates that the nature of operator scrambling in maximally chaotic systems is fundamentally different to scrambling in non-maximally chaotic systems. We also discuss a simplest scenario for the existence of a maximally chaotic regime at sufficiently large distances even for non-maximally chaotic systems.","2021-05-25","2023-09-12 13:05:04","2024-02-18 13:41:35","","229","","5","05","","JHEP","","","","","","","","","","","INSPIRE","1848001","","","32 citations (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) 28 citations w/o self (INSPIRE 2024/2/18) Citation Key: Blake:2021wqj arXiv: 2102.11294 [hep-th]","","/home/nchagnet/Zotero/storage/QRUEWL43/Blake2021wqj.pdf","","Condensed Matter - Strongly Correlated Electrons; High Energy Physics - Theory; Nonlinear Sciences - Chaotic Dynamics; Nuclear Theory; Quantum Physics","AdS-CFT Correspondence; chaos; commutation relations; Effective Field Theories; effective field theory; Gauge-gravity correspondence; hydrodynamics; Lyapunov exponent; many-body problem; suppression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
