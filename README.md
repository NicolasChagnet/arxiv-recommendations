# Analysis of Zotero library

*This is a work in progress!*

The goal of this project is to analyse and predict whether a given arXiv entry will be more likely to be saved or not based. The data used to run this analysis is both my entire Zotero library which should reflect my interests over the years as a researcher as well as a random sampling of arXiv entries over the last twenty years which have then been manually labelled.
